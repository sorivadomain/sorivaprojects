One was highly</p>\n<p>educated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years</p>\n<p>of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to</p>\n<p>Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern</p>\n<p>University to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships.</p>\n<p>The other father never finished the eighth grade.</p>\n<p>Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their</p>\n<p>lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled</p>\n<p>financially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and</p>\n<p>his church. The other left bills to be paid.</p>\n<p>Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men</p>\n<p>offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men</p>\n<p>believed strongly in education but did not recommend the same course</p>\n<p>of study.</p>\n<p>If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his</p>\n<p>advice. Having two dads offered me the choice of contrasting points</p>\n<p>of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man.</p>\n<p>Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found</p>\n<p>myself thinking more, comparing, and then choosing for myself. The</p>\n<p>problem was that the rich man was not rich yet, and the poor man</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>was not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and</p>\n<p>both were struggling with money and families. But they had very</p>\n<p>different points of view about money.</p>\n<p>For example, one dad would say, “The love of money is the root</p>\n<p>of all evil.” The other said, “The lack of money is the root of all evil.”</p>\n<p>As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me</p>\n<p>was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers</p>\n<p>did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view,</p>\n<p>particularly about money, was so extreme that I grew curious and</p>\n<p>intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about</p>\n<p>what each was saying.</p>\n<p>Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself</p>\n<p>questions such as, “Why does he say that?” and then asking the same</p>\n<p>question of the other dad’s statement. It would have been much</p>\n<p>easier to simply say, “Yeah, he’s right. I agree with that.” Or to simply</p>\n<p>reject the point of view by saying, “The old man doesn’t know what</p>\n<p>he’s talking about.” Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced</p>\n<p>me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a</p>\n<p>process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in</p>\n<p>the long run than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and</p>\n<p>the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is</p>\n<p>taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from</p>\n<p>our parents. So what can poor parents tell their child about money?</p>\n<p>They simply say, “Stay in school and study hard.” The child may</p>\n<p>graduate with excellent grades, but with a poor person’s financial</p>\n<p>programming and mindset.</p>\n<p>Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic</p>\n<p>and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how</p>\n<p>smart bankers, doctors, and accountants who earned excellent grades</p>\n<p>may struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt</p>\n<p>is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government</p>\n<p>officials making financial decisions with little or no training in the</p>\n<p>subject of money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Today I often wonder what will soon happen when we have</p>\n<p>millions of people who need financial and medical assistance. They</p>\n<p>will be dependent upon their families or the government for financial</p>\n<p>support. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run</p>\n<p>out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about</p>\n<p>money continues to be left to parents—most of whom will be, or</p>\n<p>already are, poor?</p>\n<p>Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of</p>\n<p>them. I had to think about each dad’s advice, and in doing so, I</p>\n<p>gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one’s thoughts on</p>\n<p>one’s life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford</p>\n<p>it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I ask,</p>\n<p>“How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question.</p>\n<p>One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My</p>\n<p>soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the</p>\n<p>words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the</p>\n<p>question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did</p>\n<p>not mean that you should buy everything you want. He was fanatical</p>\n<p>about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the</p>\n<p>world. He’d say, “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise</p>\n<p>it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that</p>\n<p>automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.</p>\n<p>Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a</p>\n<p>habit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to finances, and the</p>\n<p>other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was</p>\n<p>that one dad grew stronger financially, and the other grew weaker. It</p>\n<p>is not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise</p>\n<p>on a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching</p>\n<p>television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health,</p>\n<p>and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth.</p>\n<p>My two dads had opposing attitudes and that affected the way</p>\n<p>they thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in</p>\n<p>taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, “Taxes</p>\n<p>punish those who produce and reward those who don’t produce.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good</p>\n<p>company to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you</p>\n<p>can find a good company to buy.”</p>\n<p>One dad said, “The reason I’m not rich is because I have you</p>\n<p>kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have</p>\n<p>you kids.”</p>\n<p>One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner</p>\n<p>table, while the other forbade the subject of money to be discussed</p>\n<p>over a meal.</p>\n<p>One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe. Don’t take</p>\n<p>risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.”</p>\n<p>One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our</p>\n<p>greatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your</p>\n<p>house is your largest investment, you’re in trouble.”</p>\n<p>Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while</p>\n<p>the other paid his bills last.</p>\n<p>One dad believed in a company or the government taking care</p>\n<p>of you and your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises,</p>\n<p>retirement plans, medical benefits, sick leave, vacation days, and</p>\n<p>other perks. He was impressed with two of his uncles who joined the</p>\n<p>military and earned a retirement-and-entitlement package for life</p>\n<p>after twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of medical</p>\n<p>benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also</p>\n<p>loved the tenure system available through the university. The idea</p>\n<p>of job protection for life and job benefits seemed more important,</p>\n<p>at times, than the job. He would often say, “I’ve worked hard for the</p>\n<p>government, and I’m entitled to these benefits.”</p>\n<p>The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out</p>\n<p>against the entitlement mentality and how it created weak and financially</p>\n<p>needy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.</p>\n<p>One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other created</p>\n<p>investments. One dad taught me how to write an impressive resumé</p>\n<p>so I could find a good job. The other taught me how to write strong</p>\n<p>business and financial plans so I could create jobs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of</p>\n<p>observing the effects different thoughts have on one’s life. I noticed</p>\n<p>that people really do shape their lives through their thoughts.</p>\n<p>For example, my poor dad always said, “I’ll never be rich.” And</p>\n<p>that prophecy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always</p>\n<p>referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I’m a rich man,</p>\n<p>and rich people don’t do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a</p>\n<p>major financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man.</p>\n<p>He would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between</p>\n<p>being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.”</p>\n<p>My poor dad would say, “I’m not interested in money,” or</p>\n<p>“Money doesn’t matter.” My rich dad always said, “Money is power.”</p>\n<p>The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated,</p>\n<p>but it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important</p>\n<p>to be aware of my thoughts and how</p>\n<h2>There is a difference</h2>\n<p>I expressed myself. I noticed that my</p>\n<h2>between being poor</h2>\n<p>poor dad was poor, not because of the</p>\n<p>and being broke. amount of money he earned, which was</p>\n<p>Broke is temporary. significant, but because of his thoughts</p>\n<p>Poor is eternal. and actions. As a young boy having two</p>\n<p>fathers, I became acutely aware of being</p>\n<p>careful about which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. Should I</p>\n<p>listen to my rich dad or to my poor dad?</p>\n<p>Although both men had tremendous respect for education and</p>\n<p>learning, they disagreed about what they thought was important to</p>\n<p>learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree, and get a good job</p>\n<p>to earn money. He wanted me to study to become a professional, an</p>\n<p>attorney or an accountant, and to go to business school for my MBA.</p>\n<p>The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how</p>\n<p>money works, and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don’t work</p>\n<p>for money!” were words he would repeat over and over. “Money works</p>\n<p>for me!”</p>\n<p>At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich</p>\n<p>dad about money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad,</p>\n<p>even though he was the one with all the college degrees.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<h2>A Lesson from Robert Frost</h2>\n<p>Robert Frost is my favorite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my</p>\n<p>favorite is “The Road Not Taken.” I use its lesson almost daily.</p>\n<p>The Road Not Taken</p>\n<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>\n<p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>\n<p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>\n<p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>\n<p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>\n<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>\n<p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>\n<p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear</p>\n<p>Though as for that the passing there</p>\n<p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>\n<p>And both that morning equally lay</p>\n<p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>\n<p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>\n<p>Yet knowing how way leads onto way,</p>\n<p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>\n<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>\n<p>Somewhere ages and ages hence;</p>\n<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</p>\n<p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>\n<p>And that has made all the difference.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>And that has made all the difference.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost’s poem.</p>\n<p>Choosing not to listen to my highly educated dad’s advice and attitude</p>\n<p>about money was a painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped</p>\n<p>the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Once I made up my mind about whom to listen to, my education</p>\n<p>about money began. My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years</p>\n<p>until I was 39 years old. He stopped once he realized that I knew and fully</p>\n<p>understood what he had been trying to drum into my often-thick skull.</p>\n<p>Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial</p>\n<p>education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about</p>\n<p>how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building</p>\n<p>wealth. The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because</p>\n<p>most people went to school and never learned how money works, so</p>\n<p>they spend their lives working for money.</p>\n<p>Because I was only nine years old when I started, the lessons my rich</p>\n<p>dad taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there</p>\n<p>were only six main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about</p>\n<p>those six lessons, put as simply as possible, just as simply as my rich dad</p>\n<p>put forth those lessons to me. The lessons are meant not to be answers,</p>\n<p>but guideposts that will assist you and your children to grow wealthier</p>\n<p>no matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty.</p>\n<h2>Chapter One</h2>\n<h2>LESSON        1: THE    RICH      DON\'T</h2>\n<h2>WORK        FOR    MONEY</h2>\n<h2>The poor and the middle class work for money.</h2>\n<h2>The rich have money work for them.</h2>\n<p>“Dad, can you tell me how to get rich?”</p>\n<p>My dad put down the evening paper. “Why do you want to get</p>\n<p>rich, Son?”</p>\n<p>“Because today Jimmy’s mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and</p>\n<p>they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three</p>\n<p>of his friends, but Mike and I weren’t invited. They told us we weren’t</p>\n<p>invited because we were poor kids.”</p>\n<p>“They did?” my dad asked incredulously.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, they did,” I replied in a hurt tone.</p>\n<p>My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his</p>\n<p>nose, and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.</p>\n<p>The year was 1956. I was nine years old. By some twist of fate,</p>\n<p>I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their</p>\n<p>kids. We were primarily a sugar-plantation town. The managers of</p>\n<p>the plantation and the other affluent people, such as doctors, business</p>\n<p>owners, and bankers, sent their children to this elementary school.</p>\n<p>After grade six, their children were generally sent off to private</p>\n<p>schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went</p>\n<p>to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>have gone to a different school with kids from families more like</p>\n<p>mine. After grade six, these kids and I would go on to the public</p>\n<p>intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them</p>\n<p>or for me.</p>\n<p>My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking.</p>\n<p>“Well, Son…,” he began slowly. “If you want to be rich, you have</p>\n<p>to learn to make money.”</p>\n<p>“How do I make money?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, use your head, Son,” he said, smiling. Even then I knew</p>\n<p>that really meant, “That’s all I’m going to tell you,” or “I don’t know</p>\n<p>the answer, so don’t embarrass me.”</p>\n<h2>A Partnership Is Formed</h2>\n<p>The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had</p>\n<p>said. As best as I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this</p>\n<p>school. Mike was also in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had</p>\n<p>drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in</p>\n<p>school with the rich kids. We weren’t really poor, but we felt as if we</p>\n<p>were because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles,</p>\n<p>new everything.</p>\n<p>Mom and Dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter,</p>\n<p>and clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, “If you want</p>\n<p>something, work for it.” We wanted things, but there was not much</p>\n<p>work available for nine-year-old boys.</p>\n<p>“So what do we do to make money?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “But do you want to be my partner?”</p>\n<p>He agreed, and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my</p>\n<p>first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas</p>\n<p>on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the “cool</p>\n<p>guys” at Jimmy’s beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt</p>\n<p>was good, because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make</p>\n<p>money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck. It was an</p>\n<p>idea Mike got from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook</p>\n<p>hands, and the partnership now had a business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood,</p>\n<p>knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their</p>\n<p>toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a</p>\n<p>smile. Some asked us what we were doing, to which we replied, “We can’t</p>\n<p>tell you. It’s a business secret.”</p>\n<p>My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a</p>\n<p>site next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our</p>\n<p>raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that at one time held catsup</p>\n<p>bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.</p>\n<p>Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors’</p>\n<p>messy, crumpled, used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. “What are you</p>\n<p>boys doing?” she asked. “And I don’t want to hear again that it’s a business</p>\n<p>secret. Do something with this mess, or I’m going to throw it out.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon</p>\n<p>have enough and then we would begin production. We informed her</p>\n<p>that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish their toothpaste</p>\n<p>so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.</p>\n<p>The date to begin production was moved up, and the pressure was</p>\n<p>on. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction</p>\n<p>notice by my own mom! It became Mike’s job to tell the neighbors to</p>\n<p>quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to</p>\n<p>brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.</p>\n<p>One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old</p>\n<p>boys in the driveway with a production line operating at full speed.</p>\n<p>There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table were small</p>\n<p>milk cartons from school, and our family’s hibachi grill was glowing</p>\n<p>with red-hot coals at maximum heat.</p>\n<p>Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of</p>\n<p>the driveway since the production line blocked the carport. As he and</p>\n<p>his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals in</p>\n<p>which the toothpaste tubes were being melted down. In those days,</p>\n<p>toothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of</p>\n<p>lead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the</p>\n<p>small steel pot. They melted until they became liquid, and with my</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>mom’s pot holders, we poured the lead through a small hole in the</p>\n<p>top of the milk cartons.</p>\n<p>The milk cartons were filled with plaster of paris. White powder</p>\n<p>was everywhere. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the</p>\n<p>entire area looked like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk</p>\n<p>cartons were the outer containers for plaster of paris molds.</p>\n<p>My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten</p>\n<p>lead through a small hole in the top of the plaster of paris cube.</p>\n<p>“Careful,” my dad said.</p>\n<p>I nodded without looking up.</p>\n<p>Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down</p>\n<p>and smiled at my dad.</p>\n<p>“What are you boys doing?” he asked with a cautious smile.</p>\n<p>“We’re doing what you told me to do. We’re going to be rich,”</p>\n<p>I said.</p>\n<p>“Yup,” said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. “We’re partners.”</p>\n<p>“And what is in those plaster molds?” my dad asked.</p>\n<p>“Watch,” I said. “This should be a good batch.”</p>\n<p>With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube</p>\n<p>in half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a</p>\n<p>lead nickel fell out.</p>\n<p>“Oh, no!” my dad exclaimed. “You’re casting nickels out of lead!”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” Mike said. “We’re doing as you told us to do. We’re</p>\n<p>making money.”</p>\n<p>My dad’s friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled</p>\n<p>and shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste</p>\n<p>tubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white dust</p>\n<h2>smiling from ear to ear.</h2>\n<p>He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front</p>\n<p>step of our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word</p>\n<p>“counterfeiting” meant.</p>\n<p>Our dreams were dashed. “You mean this is illegal?” asked Mike</p>\n<p>in a quivering voice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>“Let them go,” my dad’s friend said. “They might be developing a</p>\n<p>natural talent.”</p>\n<p>My dad glared at him.</p>\n<p>“Yes, it is illegal,” my dad said gently. “But you boys have shown</p>\n<p>great creativity and original thought. Keep going. I’m really proud</p>\n<p>of you!”</p>\n<p>Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes</p>\n<p>before we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on</p>\n<p>opening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said,</p>\n<p>“I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor.”</p>\n<p>My father was just leaving as I said that. “Boys,” he said. “You’re</p>\n<p>only poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did</p>\n<p>something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You’ve</p>\n<p>done something. I’m very proud of the two of you. I will say it again:</p>\n<p>Keep going. Don’t quit.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we</p>\n<p>still did not know what to do.</p>\n<p>“So how come you’re not rich, Dad?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don’t</p>\n<p>think about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you,</p>\n<p>but I really don’t know how to make money.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I turned and continued our cleanup.</p>\n<p>“I know,” said my dad. “If you boys want to learn how to be</p>\n<p>rich, don’t ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike.”</p>\n<p>“My dad?” asked Mike with a scrunched-up face.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, your dad,” repeated my dad with a smile. “Your dad</p>\n<p>and I have the same banker, and he raves about your father. He’s</p>\n<p>told me several times that your father is brilliant when it comes to</p>\n<p>making money.”</p>\n<p>“My dad?” Mike asked again in disbelief. “Then how come we</p>\n<p>don’t have a nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?”</p>\n<p>“A nice car and a nice house don’t necessarily mean you’re rich or</p>\n<p>you know how to make money,” my dad replied. “Jimmy’s dad works for</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>the sugar plantation. He’s not much different from me. He works for a</p>\n<p>company, and I work for the government. The company buys the car for</p>\n<p>him. The sugar company is in financial trouble, and Jimmy’s dad may</p>\n<p>soon have nothing. Your dad is different, Mike. He seems to be building</p>\n<p>an empire, and I suspect in a few years he will be a very rich man.”</p>\n<p>With that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began</p>\n<p>cleaning up the mess caused by our now-defunct first business. As we</p>\n<p>were cleaning, we made plans for how and when to talk to Mike’s dad.</p>\n<p>The problem was that Mike’s dad worked long hours and often did not</p>\n<p>come home until late. His father owned warehouses, a construction</p>\n<p>company, a chain of stores, and three restaurants. It was the restaurants</p>\n<p>that kept him out late.</p>\n<p>Mike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He</p>\n<p>was going to talk to his dad when he got home that night and ask him</p>\n<p>if he would teach us how to become rich. Mike promised to call as soon</p>\n<p>as he had talked to his dad, even if it was late.</p>\n<p>The phone rang at 8:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>“Okay,” I said. “Next Saturday.” I put the phone down. Mike’s dad</p>\n<p>had agreed to meet with us.</p>\n<p>On Saturday I caught the 7:30 a.m. bus to the poor side of town.</p>\n<h2>The Lessons Begin</h2>\n<p>Mike and I met with his dad that morning at eight o’clock. He</p>\n<p>was already busy, having been at work for more than an hour. His</p>\n<p>construction supervisor was just leaving in his pickup truck as I walked</p>\n<p>up to his simple, small, and tidy home. Mike met me at the door.</p>\n<p>“Dad’s on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch,”</p>\n<p>Mike said as he opened the door.</p>\n<p>The old wooden floor creaked as I stepped across the threshold of</p>\n<p>the aging house. There was a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat</p>\n<p>was there to hide the years of wear from countless footsteps that the</p>\n<p>floor had supported. Although clean, it needed to be replaced.</p>\n<p>I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room that</p>\n<p>was filled with old musty overstuffed furniture that today would be</p>\n<p>collectors’ items. Sitting on the couch were two women, both a little</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>older than my mom. Across from the women sat a man in workman’s</p>\n<p>clothes. He wore khaki slacks and a khaki shirt, neatly pressed but</p>\n<p>without starch, and polished work boots. He was about 10 years older</p>\n<p>than my dad. They smiled as Mike and I walked past them toward the</p>\n<p>back porch. I smiled back shyly.</p>\n<p>“Who are those people?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses,</p>\n<p>and the women are the managers of the restaurants. And as you</p>\n<p>arrived, you saw the construction supervisor who is working on a</p>\n<p>road project about 50 miles from here. His other supervisor, who is</p>\n<p>building a track of houses, left before you got here.”</p>\n<p>“Does this go on all the time?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Not always, but quite often,” said Mike, smiling as he pulled up</p>\n<p>a chair to sit down next to me.</p>\n<p>“I asked my dad if he would teach us to make money,” Mike said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, and what did he say to that?” I asked with cautious curiosity.</p>\n<p>“Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he</p>\n<p>would make us an offer.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” I said, rocking my chair back against the wall. I sat there</p>\n<p>perched on two rear legs of the chair.</p>\n<p>Mike did the same thing.</p>\n<p>“Do you know what the offer is?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No, but we’ll soon find out.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Mike’s dad burst through the rickety screen door and</p>\n<p>onto the porch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect,</p>\n<p>but because we were startled.</p>\n<p>“Ready, boys?” he asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down with us.</p>\n<p>We nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall</p>\n<h2>to sit in front of him.</h2>\n<p>He was a big man, about six feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was</p>\n<p>taller, about the same weight, and five years older than Mike’s dad. They</p>\n<p>sort of looked alike, though not of the same ethnic makeup. Maybe their</p>\n<p>energy was similar.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“Mike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?”</p>\n<p>I nodded my head quickly, but with a little trepidation. He had</p>\n<p>a lot of power behind his words and smile.</p>\n<p>“Okay, here’s my offer. I’ll teach you, but I won’t do it classroom-</p>\n<p>style. You work for me, I’ll teach you. You don’t work for me, I won’t</p>\n<p>teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I’m wasting my time if</p>\n<p>you just want to sit and listen like you do in school. That’s my offer. Take</p>\n<p>it or leave it.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, may I ask a question first?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No. Take it or leave it. I’ve got too much work to do to waste</p>\n<p>my time. If you can’t make up your mind decisively, then you’ll never</p>\n<p>learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able</p>\n<p>to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have</p>\n<p>the opportunity that you asked for. School is beginning, or it’s over in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>seconds,” Mike’s dad said with a teasing smile.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Take it,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Take it,” said Mike.</p>\n<p>“Good,” said Mike’s dad. “Mrs. Martin will be by in 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>After I’m through with her, you’ll ride with her to my superette and</p>\n<p>you can begin working. I’ll pay you 10 cents an hour, and you’ll work</p>\n<p>three hours every Saturday.”</p>\n<p>“But I have a softball game today,” I said.</p>\n<p>Mike’s dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. “Take it, or leave it,”</p>\n<p>he said.</p>\n<p>“I’ll take it,” I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing.</p>\n<h2>Thirty Cents Later</h2>\n<p>By 9:00 a.m. that day, Mike and I were working for Mrs. Martin.</p>\n<p>She was a kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I</p>\n<p>reminded her of her two grown sons. Although kind, she believed in hard</p>\n<p>work and kept us moving. We spent three hours taking canned goods off</p>\n<p>the shelves, brushing each can with a feather duster to get the dust off,</p>\n<p>and then re-stacking them neatly. It was excruciatingly boring work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Mike’s dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little</p>\n<p>superettes, each with a large parking lot. They were the early version</p>\n<p>of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, little neighborhood grocery stores</p>\n<p>where people bought items such as milk, bread, butter, and cigarettes.</p>\n<p>The problem was that this was Hawaii before air-conditioning was</p>\n<p>widely used, and the stores could not close their doors because of the</p>\n<p>heat. On two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the</p>\n<p>road and parking lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the</p>\n<p>parking lot, dust would swirl and settle in the store. We knew we had</p>\n<p>a job as long as there was no air-conditioning.</p>\n<p>For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked</p>\n<p>our three hours. By noon, our work was over, and she dropped three little</p>\n<p>dimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age of nine in the mid-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>s, 30 cents was not too exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back</li>\n</ul>\n<p>then, so I usually spent my money on comic books and went home.</p>\n<p>By Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had</p>\n<p>agreed to work only because I wanted to learn to make money from</p>\n<p>Mike’s dad, and now I was a slave for 10 cents an hour. On top of</p>\n<p>that, I had not seen Mike’s dad since that first Saturday.</p>\n<p>“I’m quitting,” I told Mike at lunchtime. School was boring, and</p>\n<p>now I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. But it was</p>\n<p>the 30 cents that really got to me.</p>\n<p>This time Mike smiled.</p>\n<p>“What are you laughing at?” I asked with anger and frustration.</p>\n<p>“Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when</p>\n<p>you were ready to quit.”</p>\n<p>“What?” I said indignantly. “He’s been waiting for me to get</p>\n<p>fed up?”</p>\n<p>“Sort of,” Mike said. “Dad’s kind of different. He doesn’t teach like</p>\n<p>your dad. Your mom and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man</p>\n<p>of few words. You just wait till this Saturday. I’ll tell him you’re ready.”</p>\n<p>“You mean I’ve been set up?”</p>\n<p>“No, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<h2>Waiting in Line on Saturday</h2>\n<p>I was ready to face Mike’s dad. Even my real dad was angry with</p>\n<p>him. My real dad, the one I call the poor one, thought that my rich dad</p>\n<p>was violating child labor laws and should be investigated.</p>\n<p>My educated, poor dad told me to demand what I deserve—at least</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cents an hour. My poor dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I</li>\n</ul>\n<p>was to quit immediately.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need that damned job anyway,” said my poor dad</p>\n<p>with indignation.</p>\n<p>At eight o’clock Saturday morning, I walked through the door of</p>\n<p>Mike’s house when Mike’s dad opened it.</p>\n<p>“Take a seat and wait in line,” he said as I entered. He turned and</p>\n<p>disappeared into his little office next to a bedroom.</p>\n<p>I looked around the room and didn’t see Mike anywhere. Feeling</p>\n<p>awkward, I cautiously sat down next to the same two women who were</p>\n<p>there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid down the couch to make</p>\n<p>room for me.</p>\n<p>Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women</p>\n<p>had met with him and left 30 minutes earlier. An older gentleman was</p>\n<p>in there for 20 minutes and was also gone.</p>\n<p>The house was empty, and here I sat in a musty, dark living room</p>\n<p>on a beautiful sunny Hawaiian day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who</p>\n<p>exploited children. I could hear him rustling around the office, talking</p>\n<p>on the phone, and ignoring me. I was ready to walk out, but for some</p>\n<p>reason I stayed.</p>\n<p>Finally, 15 minutes later, at exactly nine o’clock, rich dad walked out</p>\n<p>of his office, said nothing, and signaled with his hand for me to enter.</p>\n<p>“I understand you want a raise, or you’re going to quit,” rich dad</p>\n<h2>said as he swiveled in his office chair.</h2>\n<p>“Well, you’re not keeping your end of the bargain,” I blurted out,</p>\n<p>nearly in tears. It was really frightening for me to confront a grown-up.</p>\n<p>“You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I’ve</p>\n<p>worked for you. I’ve worked hard. I’ve given up my baseball games to</p>\n<p>work for you, but you haven’t kept your word, and you haven’t taught</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>me anything. You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are.</p>\n<p>You’re greedy. You want all the money and don’t take care of your</p>\n<p>employees. You made me wait and don’t show me any respect. I’m</p>\n<p>only a little boy, but I deserve to be treated better.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin,</p>\n<p>and stared at me.</p>\n<p>“Not bad,” he said. “In less than a month, you sound like most</p>\n<p>of my employees.”</p>\n<p>“What?” I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I</p>\n<p>continued with my grievance. “I thought you were going to keep</p>\n<p>your end of the bargain and teach me. Instead you want to torture</p>\n<p>me? That’s cruel. That’s really cruel.”</p>\n<p>“I am teaching you,” rich dad said quietly.</p>\n<p>“What have you taught me? Nothing!” I said angrily. “You haven’t</p>\n<p>even talked to me once since I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an</p>\n<p>hour. Hah! I should notify the government about you. We have child</p>\n<p>labor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you know.”</p>\n<p>“Wow!” said rich dad. “Now you sound just like most of the people</p>\n<p>who used to work for me—people I’ve either fired or who have quit.”</p>\n<p>“So what do you have to say?” I demanded, feeling pretty brave</p>\n<p>for a little kid. “You lied to me. I’ve worked for you, and you have not</p>\n<p>kept your word. You haven’t taught me anything.”</p>\n<p>“How do you know that I’ve not taught you anything?” asked rich</p>\n<p>dad calmly.</p>\n<p>“Well, you’ve never talked to me. I’ve worked for three weeks and</p>\n<p>you have not taught me anything,” I said with a pout.</p>\n<p>“Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?” rich dad asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, yes,” I replied.</p>\n<p>“That’s how they teach you in school,” he said, smiling. “But</p>\n<p>that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best</p>\n<p>teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort</p>\n<p>of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, ‘Wake up. There’s</p>\n<p>something I want you to learn.’”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“What is this man talking about?” I asked myself silently. “Life</p>\n<p>pushing me around was life talking to me?” Now I knew I had to quit</p>\n<p>my job. I was talking to someone who needed to be locked up.</p>\n<p>“If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just</p>\n<p>continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life</p>\n<p>push them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push</p>\n<p>back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They</p>\n<p>do not know it’s life that’s pushing.”</p>\n<p>I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>\n<p>“Life pushes all of us around. Some people give up and others</p>\n<p>fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing</p>\n<p>them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to</p>\n<p>learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like</p>\n<p>you fight.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that</p>\n<p>needed repair. “If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise,</p>\n<p>wealthy, and happy young man. If you don’t, you will spend your</p>\n<p>life blaming a job, low pay, or your boss for your problems. You’ll</p>\n<p>live life always hoping for that big break that will solve all your</p>\n<p>money problems.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes</p>\n<p>met mine. We stared at each other, communicating through our eyes.</p>\n<p>Finally, I looked away once I had absorbed his message. I knew he</p>\n<p>was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.</p>\n<p>Rich dad continued, “Or if you’re the kind of person who has</p>\n<p>no guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you’re that</p>\n<p>kind of person, you’ll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right</p>\n<p>things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then you</p>\n<p>die a boring old man. You’ll have lots of friends who really like you</p>\n<p>because you were such a nice hardworking guy. But the truth is that</p>\n<p>you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified</p>\n<p>of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was</p>\n<p>greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only</p>\n<p>you will know you didn’t go for it. You chose to play it safe.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Our eyes met again.</p>\n<p>“You’ve been pushing me around?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Some people might say that,” smiled rich dad. “I would say that</p>\n<p>I just gave you a taste of life.”</p>\n<p>“What taste of life?” I asked, still angry, but now curious and</p>\n<p>ready to learn.</p>\n<p>“You boys are the first people who have ever asked me to teach</p>\n<p>them how to make money. I have more than 150 employees, and not</p>\n<p>one of them has asked me what I know about money. They ask me for</p>\n<p>a job and a paycheck, but never to teach them about money. So most</p>\n<p>will spend the best years of their lives working for money, not really</p>\n<p>understanding what it is they are working for.”</p>\n<p>I sat there listening intently.</p>\n<p>“So when Mike told me you wanted to learn how to make money,</p>\n<p>I decided to design a course that mirrored real life. I could talk until</p>\n<p>I was blue in the face, but you wouldn’t hear a thing. So I decided to</p>\n<p>let life push you around a bit so you could hear me. That’s why I only</p>\n<p>paid you 10 cents.”</p>\n<p>“So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an</p>\n<p>hour?” I asked. “That you’re cheap and exploit your workers?”</p>\n<p>Rich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally he said,</p>\n<p>“You’d best change your point of view. Stop blaming me and thinking</p>\n<p>I’m the problem. If you think I’m the problem, then you have to</p>\n<p>change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can</p>\n<p>change yourself, learn something, and grow wiser. Most people want</p>\n<p>everyone else in the world to change but themselves. Let me tell you,</p>\n<p>it’s easier to change yourself than everyone else.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t understand,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t blame me for your problems,” rich dad said, growing impatient.</p>\n<p>“But you only pay me 10 cents.”</p>\n<p>“So what are you learning?” rich dad asked, smiling.</p>\n<p>“That you’re cheap,” I said with a sly grin.</p>\n<p>“See, you think I’m the problem,” said rich dad.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“But you are.”</p>\n<p>“Well, keep that attitude and you’ll learn nothing. Keep the</p>\n<p>attitude that I’m the problem and what choices do you have?”</p>\n<p>“Well, if you don’t pay me more or show me more respect and</p>\n<p>teach me, I’ll quit.”</p>\n<p>“Well put,” rich dad said. “And that’s exactly what most people</p>\n<p>do. They quit and go looking for another job, a better opportunity,</p>\n<p>and higher pay, actually thinking that this will solve the problem. In</p>\n<p>most cases, it won’t.”</p>\n<p>“So what should I do?” I asked. “Just take this measly 10 cents an</p>\n<p>hour and smile?”</p>\n<p>Rich dad smiled. “That’s what the other people do. But that’s all</p>\n<p>they do, waiting for a raise thinking that more money will solve their</p>\n<p>problems. Most just accept it, and some take a second job working</p>\n<p>harder, but again accepting a small paycheck.”</p>\n<p>I sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson</p>\n<p>rich dad was presenting. I could sense it was a taste of life. Finally,</p>\n<p>I looked up and asked, “So what will solve the problem?”</p>\n<p>“This,” he said, leaning forward in his chair and tapping me</p>\n<p>gently on the head. “This stuff between your ears.”</p>\n<p>It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of</p>\n<p>view that separated him from his employees and my poor dad—and</p>\n<p>led him to eventually become one of the richest men in Hawaii, while</p>\n<p>my highly educated but poor dad struggled financially all his life.</p>\n<p>It was a singular point of view that made all the difference over</p>\n<p>a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Rich dad explained this point of view over and over, which I call</p>\n<p>lesson number one: The poor and the middle class work for money. The</p>\n<p>rich have money work for them.</p>\n<p>On that bright Saturday morning, I learned a completely different</p>\n<p>point of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad. At the age</p>\n<p>of nine, I understood that both dads wanted me to learn. Both dads</p>\n<p>encouraged me to study, but not the same things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did.</p>\n<p>“Son, I want you to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a</p>\n<p>safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has excellent</p>\n<p>benefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I</p>\n<p>could make it work for me.</p>\n<p>These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not</p>\n<p>because of a classroom.</p>\n<p>My rich dad continued my first lesson, “I’m glad you got angry</p>\n<p>about working for 10 cents an hour. If you hadn’t got angry and had</p>\n<p>simply accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you.</p>\n<p>You see, true learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger</p>\n<p>is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined.</p>\n<p>When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel</p>\n<p>secure. So passion does not direct them. Fear does.”</p>\n<p>“So is that why they’ll take jobs with low pay?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad. “Some people say I exploit people because</p>\n<p>I don’t pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I</p>\n<p>say the people exploit themselves. It’s their fear, not mine.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you feel you should pay them more?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I don’t have to. And besides, more money will not solve their</p>\n<p>problems. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he</p>\n<p>still can’t pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into</p>\n<p>more debt.”</p>\n<p>“So that’s why the 10 cents an hour,” I said, smiling. “It’s a part</p>\n<p>of the lesson.”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” smiled rich dad. “You see, your dad went to school</p>\n<p>and got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. But</p>\n<p>he still has money problems because he never learned anything about</p>\n<p>money in school. On top of that, he believes in working for money.”</p>\n<p>“And you don’t?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No, not really,” said rich dad. “If you want to learn to work for</p>\n<p>money, then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that.</p>\n<p>But if you want to learn how to have money work for you, then I will</p>\n<p>teach you that. But only if you want to learn.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“Wouldn’t everyone want to learn that?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No,” said rich dad, “simply because it’s easier to learn to work for</p>\n<p>money, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of</p>\n<p>money is discussed.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t understand,” I said with a frown.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about that for now. Just know that it’s fear that keeps</p>\n<p>most people working at a job: the fear of not paying their bills, the fear</p>\n<p>of being fired, the fear of not having enough money, and the fear of</p>\n<p>starting over. That’s the price of studying to learn a profession or trade,</p>\n<p>and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money—</p>\n<p>and then get angry at their boss.”</p>\n<p>“Learning to have money work for you is a completely different</p>\n<p>course of study?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Absolutely,” rich dad answered. “Absolutely.”</p>\n<p>We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My</p>\n<p>friends had just started their Little League baseball game, but for some</p>\n<p>reason I was now thankful I had decided to work for 10 cents an hour.</p>\n<p>I sensed that I was about to learn something my friends wouldn’t learn</p>\n<p>in school.</p>\n<p>“Ready to learn?” asked rich dad.</p>\n<p>“Absolutely,” I said with a grin.</p>\n<p>“I have kept my promise. I’ve been teaching you from afar,” my rich</p>\n<p>dad said. “At nine years old, you’ve gotten a taste of what it feels like to</p>\n<p>work for money. Just multiply your last month by fifty years and you</p>\n<p>will have an idea of what most people spend their life doing.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t understand,” I said.</p>\n<p>“How did you feel waiting in line to see me, once to get hired and</p>\n<p>once to ask for more money?”</p>\n<p>“Terrible,” I said.</p>\n<p>“If you choose to work for money, that is what life will be like,” said</p>\n<p>rich dad.</p>\n<p>“And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in</p>\n<p>your hand for three hours of work?”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>“I felt like it wasn’t enough. It seemed like nothing. I was</p>\n<p>disappointed,” I said.</p>\n<p>“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their</p>\n<p>paychecks—especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken</p>\n<p>out. At least you got 100 percent.”</p>\n<p>“You mean most workers don’t get paid everything?” I asked</p>\n<p>with amazement.</p>\n<p>“Heavens no!” said rich dad. “The government always takes its</p>\n<p>share first.”</p>\n<p>“How do they do that?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Taxes,” said rich dad. “You’re taxed when you earn. You’re</p>\n<p>taxed when you spend. You’re taxed when you save. You’re taxed</p>\n<p>when you die.”</p>\n<p>“Why do people let the government do that to them?”</p>\n<p>“The rich don’t,” said rich dad with a smile. “The poor and the</p>\n<p>middle class do. I’ll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he</p>\n<p>pays more in taxes.”</p>\n<p>“How can that be?” I asked. At my age, that made no sense to me.</p>\n<p>“Why would someone let the government do that to them?”</p>\n<p>Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me.</p>\n<p>“Ready to learn?” he asked.</p>\n<p>I nodded my head slowly.</p>\n<p>“As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work</p>\n<p>for you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years,</p>\n<p>and their education ends. I already know that my study of money will</p>\n<p>continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I find out, the</p>\n<p>more I find out I need to know. Most people never study the subject.</p>\n<p>They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and</p>\n<p>that’s it. Then they wonder why they have money problems. They think</p>\n<p>that more money will solve the problem and don’t realize that it’s their</p>\n<p>lack of financial education that is the problem.”</p>\n<p>“So my dad has tax problems because he doesn’t understand</p>\n<p>money?” I asked, confused.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“Look,” said rich dad, “taxes are just one small section on learning</p>\n<p>how to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if</p>\n<p>you still have the passion to learn about money. Most people don’t.</p>\n<p>They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work,</p>\n<p>and earn lots of money. One day they wake up with big money</p>\n<p>problems, and then they can’t stop working. That’s the price of only</p>\n<p>knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have</p>\n<p>money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?” asked</p>\n<p>rich dad.</p>\n<p>I nodded my head.</p>\n<p>“Good,” said rich dad. “Now get back to work. This time, I will</p>\n<p>pay you nothing.”</p>\n<p>“What?” I asked in amazement.</p>\n<p>“You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours</p>\n<p>every Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour.</p>\n<p>You said you wanted to learn to not work for money, so I’m not going</p>\n<p>to pay you anything.”</p>\n<p>I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.</p>\n<p>“I’ve already had this conversation with Mike and he’s already</p>\n<p>working, dusting and stacking canned goods for free. You’d better</p>\n<p>hurry and get back there.”</p>\n<p>“That’s not fair,” I shouted. “You’ve got to pay something!”</p>\n<p>“You said you wanted to learn. If you don’t learn this now, you’ll</p>\n<p>grow up to be like the two women and the older man sitting in my</p>\n<p>living room, working for money and hoping I don’t fire them. Or like</p>\n<p>your dad, earning lots of money only to be in debt up to his eyeballs,</p>\n<p>hoping more money will solve the problem. If that’s what you want,</p>\n<p>I’ll go back to our original deal of 10 cents an hour. Or you can do</p>\n<p>what most adults do: Complain that there is not enough pay, quit,</p>\n<p>and go looking for another job.”</p>\n<p>“But what do I do?” I asked.</p>\n<p>Rich dad tapped me on the head. “Use this,” he said. “If you use</p>\n<p>it well, you will soon thank me for giving you an opportunity and</p>\n<p>you will grow into a rich man.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>I stood there, still not believing what a raw deal I was handed. I came</p>\n<p>to ask for a raise, and somehow I was instead working for nothing.</p>\n<p>Rich dad tapped me on the head again and said, “Use this. Now</p>\n<p>get out of here and get back to work.”</p>\n<h2>Lesson #1: The Rich Don’t Work for Money</h2>\n<p>I didn’t tell my poor dad I wasn’t being paid. He wouldn’t have</p>\n<p>understood, and I didn’t want to try to explain something I didn’t</p>\n<p>understand myself.</p>\n<p>For three more weeks, Mike and I worked three hours every</p>\n<p>Saturday for nothing. The work didn’t bother me, and the routine</p>\n<p>got easier, but it was the missed baseball games and not being able</p>\n<p>to afford to buy a few comic books that got to me.</p>\n<p>Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his</p>\n<p>truck pull up in the parking lot and sputter when the engine was</p>\n<p>turned off. He entered the store and greeted Mrs. Martin with a hug.</p>\n<p>After finding out how things were going in the store, he reached into</p>\n<p>the ice-cream freezer, pulled out two bars, paid for them, and signaled</p>\n<p>to Mike and me.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go for a walk, boys.”</p>\n<p>We crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a</p>\n<p>large grassy field where a few adults were playing softball. Sitting</p>\n<p>down at a lone picnic table, he handed Mike and me the treats.</p>\n<p>“How’s it going, boys?”</p>\n<p>“Okay,” Mike said.</p>\n<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p>“Learn anything yet?” rich dad asked.</p>\n<p>Mike and I looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders, and</p>\n<p>shook our heads in unison.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding One of Life’s Biggest Traps</h2>\n<p>“Well, you boys had better start thinking. You’re staring at one of</p>\n<p>life’s biggest lessons. If you learn it, you’ll enjoy a life of great freedom</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>and security. If you don’t, you’ll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of</p>\n<p>the people playing softball in this park. They work very hard for little</p>\n<p>money, clinging to the illusion of job security and looking forward to a</p>\n<p>three-week vacation each year and maybe a skimpy pension after forty-</p>\n<p>five years of service. If that excites you, I’ll give you a raise to 25 cents</p>\n<p>an hour.”</p>\n<p>“But these are good hardworking people. Are you making fun of</p>\n<p>them?” I demanded.</p>\n<p>A smile came over rich dad’s face.</p>\n<p>“Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel.</p>\n<p>I may sound unkind because I’m doing my best to point something out</p>\n<p>to the two of you. I want to expand your point of view so you can see</p>\n<p>something most people never have the benefit of seeing because their</p>\n<p>vision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I sat there, uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel,</p>\n<p>yet we could sense he was trying to drive home a point.</p>\n<p>With a smile, rich dad said, “Doesn’t that 25 cents an hour sound</p>\n<p>good? Doesn’t it make your heart beat a little faster?”</p>\n<p>I shook my head no, but it really did. Twenty-five cents an hour</p>\n<p>would be big bucks to me.</p>\n<p>“Okay, I’ll pay you a dollar an hour,” rich dad said, with a sly grin.</p>\n<p>Now my heart started to race. My brain was screaming, “Take it.</p>\n<p>Take it.” I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing.</p>\n<p>“Okay, two dollars an hour.”</p>\n<p>My little brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956</p>\n<p>and being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in</p>\n<p>the world. I couldn’t imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to</p>\n<p>say yes. I wanted the deal. I could picture a new bicycle, new baseball</p>\n<p>glove, and the adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends could never call me poor</p>\n<p>again. But somehow my mouth stayed shut.</p>\n<p>The ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. Rich</p>\n<p>dad was looking at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and</p>\n<p>brains empty. He was testing us, and he knew there was a part of our</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>emotions that wanted to take the deal. He understood that every</p>\n<p>person has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought,</p>\n<p>and he knew that every individual also had a part of their soul that</p>\n<p>was resilient and could never be bought. It was only a question of</p>\n<p>which one was stronger.</p>\n<p>“Okay, five dollars an hour.”</p>\n<p>Suddenly I was silent. Something had changed. The offer was too</p>\n<p>big and ridiculous. Not many grown-ups in 1956 made more than</p>\n<p>that, but quickly my temptation disappeared, and calm set in. Slowly,</p>\n<p>I turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part</p>\n<p>of my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that</p>\n<p>had no price took over. I knew Mike</p>\n<h2>People’s lives are had gotten to that point too.</h2>\n<p>forever controlled “Good,” rich dad said softly. “Most</p>\n<p>by two emotions: people have a price. And they have a</p>\n<p>fear and greed. price because of human emotions named</p>\n<p>fear and greed. First, the fear of being</p>\n<p>without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that</p>\n<p>paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful</p>\n<p>things money can buy. The pattern is then set.”</p>\n<p>“What pattern?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills; get up, go to work,</p>\n<p>pay bills. People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear</p>\n<p>and greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by</p>\n<p>increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.”</p>\n<p>“There is another way?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad slowly. “But only a few people find it.”</p>\n<p>“And what is that way?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study</p>\n<p>with me. That is why I took away all forms of pay.”</p>\n<p>“Any hints?” Mike asked. “We’re kind of tired of working hard,</p>\n<p>especially for nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Well, the first step is telling the truth,” said rich dad.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t been lying,” I said.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“I did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth,” rich</p>\n<p>dad retorted.</p>\n<p>“The truth about what?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“How you’re feeling,” rich dad said. “You don’t have to say it</p>\n<p>to anyone else. Just admit it to yourself.”</p>\n<p>“You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you,</p>\n<p>Mrs. Martin, they don’t do that?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I doubt it,” said rich dad. “Instead, they feel the fear of not</p>\n<p>having money. They don’t confront it logically. They react emotionally</p>\n<p>instead of using their heads,” rich dad said. “Then, they get a few</p>\n<p>bucks in their hands and again, the emotions of joy, desire, and greed</p>\n<p>take over. And again they react, instead of think.”</p>\n<p>“So their emotions control their brain,” Mike said.</p>\n<p>“That’s correct,” said rich dad. “Instead of admitting the truth</p>\n<p>about how they feel, they react to their feelings and fail to think.</p>\n<p>They feel the fear so they go to work, hoping that money will soothe</p>\n<p>the fear, but it doesn’t. It continues to haunt them and they return</p>\n<p>to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it</p>\n<p>doesn’t. Fear keeps them in this trap of working, earning money,</p>\n<p>working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day</p>\n<p>they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of</p>\n<p>people that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of</p>\n<p>turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a</p>\n<p>paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running</p>\n<p>their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in</p>\n<p>control of their emotions and their souls.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard</p>\n<p>what he said but didn’t understand fully what he was talking about.</p>\n<p>I just knew that I often wondered why grown-ups hurried off to</p>\n<p>work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that</p>\n<p>happy, but something kept them going.</p>\n<p>Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was</p>\n<p>talking about, rich dad said, “I want you boys to avoid that trap.</p>\n<p>That is really what I want to teach you. Not just to be rich, because</p>\n<p>being rich does not solve the problem.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t?” I asked, surprised.</p>\n<p>“No, it doesn’t. Let me explain the other emotion: desire. Some</p>\n<p>call it greed, but I prefer desire. It’s perfectly normal to desire something</p>\n<p>better, prettier, more fun, or exciting. So people also work for money</p>\n<p>because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy.</p>\n<p>But the joy that money brings is often short-lived, and they soon need</p>\n<p>more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, and more</p>\n<p>security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls</p>\n<p>that are troubled by fear and desire. But money can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>“Even rich people do this?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“Rich people included,” said rich dad. “In fact, the reason many rich</p>\n<p>people are rich isn’t because of desire, but because of fear. They believe</p>\n<p>that money can eliminate the fear of being poor, so they amass tons of it,</p>\n<p>only to find the fear gets worse. Now they fear losing the money. I have</p>\n<p>friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people</p>\n<p>who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor.</p>\n<p>They’re terrified of losing it all. The fears that drove them to get rich</p>\n<p>got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming</p>\n<p>louder. They don’t want to lose the big houses, the cars and the high life</p>\n<p>money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say</p>\n<p>if they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic,</p>\n<p>although they look rich and have more money.”</p>\n<p>“So is a poor man happier?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t think so,” replied rich dad. “The avoidance of money</p>\n<p>is just as psychotic as being attached to money.”</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by</p>\n<p>the large rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us</p>\n<p>watched him with great interest, when before we probably would</p>\n<p>have just ignored him.</p>\n<p>Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the</p>\n<p>older man. Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately,</p>\n<p>took the bill, thanked rich dad profusely, and hurried off, ecstatic</p>\n<p>with his good fortune.</p>\n<p>“He’s not much different from most of my employees,” said rich</p>\n<p>dad. “I’ve met so many people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day. That’s a denial of</p>\n<p>truth. If they weren’t interested in money, then why are they working?</p>\n<p>That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who</p>\n<p>hoards money.”</p>\n<p>As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind flashed back to</p>\n<p>the countless times my own dad said, “I’m not interested in money.”</p>\n<p>He said those words often. He also</p>\n<p>So many people say, covered himself by always saying,</p>\n<h2>“Oh, I’m not   “I work because I love my job.”</h2>\n<p>interested in money.” “So what do we do?” I asked. “Not</p>\n<p>Yet they’ll work work for money until all traces of fear</p>\n<h2>at a job for  and greed are gone?”</h2>\n<p>eight hours a day. “No, that would be a waste of time,”</p>\n<p>said rich dad. “Emotions are what make</p>\n<p>us human. The word ‘emotion’ stands for ‘energy in motion.’ Be</p>\n<p>truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions in</p>\n<p>your favor, not against yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Whoa!” said Mike.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in</p>\n<p>years to come. Just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions.</p>\n<p>Most people do not know that it’s their emotions that are doing the</p>\n<p>thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn</p>\n<p>to do your own thinking.”</p>\n<p>“Can you give me an example?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Sure,” replied rich dad. “When a person says, ‘I need to find</p>\n<p>a job,’ it’s most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not</p>\n<p>having money generates that thought.”</p>\n<p>“But people do need money if they have bills to pay,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Sure they do,” smiled rich dad. “All I’m saying is that it’s fear that</p>\n<p>is all too often doing the thinking.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t understand,” said Mike.</p>\n<p>“For example,” said rich dad. “If the fear of not having enough</p>\n<p>money arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job, they</p>\n<p>instead might ask themselves this question: ‘Will a job be the best</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>solution to this fear over the long run?’ In my opinion, the answer is</p>\n<p>no. A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.”</p>\n<p>“But my dad is always saying, ‘Stay in school and get good grades,</p>\n<p>so you can find a safe, secure job,’” I interjected, somewhat confused.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I understand he says that,” said rich dad, smiling. “Most people</p>\n<p>recommend that, and it’s a good path for most people. But people make</p>\n<p>that recommendation primarily out of fear.”</p>\n<p>“You mean my dad says that because he’s afraid?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad. “He’s terrified that you won’t earn enough</p>\n<p>money and won’t fit into society. Don’t get me wrong. He loves you</p>\n<p>and wants the best for you. I too believe an education and a job are</p>\n<p>important, but it won’t handle the fear. You see, that same fear that</p>\n<p>makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that</p>\n<p>is causing him to be so fanatical about your going to school.”</p>\n<p>“So what do you recommend?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I want to teach you to master the power of money, instead of</p>\n<p>being afraid of it. They don’t teach that in school and, if you don’t</p>\n<p>learn it, you become a slave to money.”</p>\n<p>It was finally making sense. He wanted us to widen our views</p>\n<p>and to see what the Mrs. Martins of this world couldn’t see. He used</p>\n<p>examples that sounded cruel at the time, but I’ve never forgotten</p>\n<p>them. My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that</p>\n<p>lay ahead for most people.</p>\n<p>“You see, we’re all employees ultimately. We just work at different</p>\n<p>levels,” said rich dad. “I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid</p>\n<p>the trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in</p>\n<p>your favor, not against you. That’s what I want to teach you. I’m not</p>\n<p>interested in just teaching you to make a pile of money. That won’t</p>\n<p>handle the fear or desire. If you don’t first handle fear and desire, and</p>\n<p>you get rich, you’ll only be a highly paid slave.”</p>\n<p>“So how do we avoid the trap?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and</p>\n<p>ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It’s</p>\n<p>self-inflicted fear and ignorance that keep people trapped. So you</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>boys go to school and get your college degrees, and I’ll teach you</p>\n<p>how to stay out of the trap.”</p>\n<p>The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad</p>\n<p>had a great education and a great career, but school never told him</p>\n<p>how to handle money or his fear of it. It became clear that I could</p>\n<p>learn different and important things from two fathers.</p>\n<p>“So you’ve been talking about the fear of not having money. How</p>\n<p>does the desire for money affect our thinking?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you</p>\n<p>notice your desires rising?”</p>\n<p>We nodded our heads.</p>\n<p>“By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay</p>\n<p>your reactions and think. That is important. We will always have</p>\n<p>emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it’s imperative for you</p>\n<p>to use those emotions to your advantage, and for the long term to not</p>\n<p>let your emotions control your thinking. Most people use fear and</p>\n<p>greed against themselves. That’s the start of ignorance. Most people</p>\n<p>live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because</p>\n<p>of the emotions of desire and fear, not really questioning where those</p>\n<p>emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It’s just like the picture of</p>\n<p>a donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front</p>\n<p>of its nose. The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to, but</p>\n<p>the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only be another</p>\n<p>carrot for the donkey.”</p>\n<p>“You mean the moment I picture a new baseball glove, candy and</p>\n<p>toys, that’s like a carrot to a donkey?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, and as you get older, your toys get more expensive—a new</p>\n<p>car, a boat, and a big house to impress your friends,” said rich dad</p>\n<p>with a smile. “Fear pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you.</p>\n<p>That’s the trap.”</p>\n<p>“So what’s the answer,” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich</p>\n<p>people with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get.</p>\n<p>Money is the carrot, the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole</p>\n<p>picture, it might rethink its choice to chase the carrot.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Rich dad went on to explain that a human’s life is a struggle</p>\n<p>between ignorance and illumination.</p>\n<p>He explained that once a person stops searching for information</p>\n<p>and self-knowledge, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-</p>\n<p>moment decision—to learn to open or close one’s mind.</p>\n<p>“Look, school is very important. You go to school to learn a skill</p>\n<p>or profession to become a contributing member of society. Every</p>\n<p>culture needs teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, businesspeople,</p>\n<p>police officers, firefighters, and soldiers. Schools train them so society</p>\n<p>can thrive and flourish,” said rich dad. “Unfortunately, for many people</p>\n<p>school is the end, not the beginning.”</p>\n<p>There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I didn’t</p>\n<p>comprehend everything he said that day. But as with most great</p>\n<p>teachers, his words continued to teach for years.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been a little cruel today,” said rich dad. “But I want you</p>\n<p>to always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs.</p>\n<p>Martin. And I want you always to remember that donkey. Never</p>\n<p>forget that fear and desire can lead you into life’s biggest trap if you’re</p>\n<p>not aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life</p>\n<p>living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for</p>\n<p>money, thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy</p>\n<p>is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about</p>\n<p>paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size</p>\n<p>of a paycheck is not really living a life. Thinking that a job makes you</p>\n<p>secure is lying to yourself. That’s cruel, and that’s the trap I want</p>\n<p>you to avoid. I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives. Don’t let that</p>\n<p>happen to you. Please don’t let money run your life.”</p>\n<p>A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw</p>\n<h2>it back.</h2>\n<p>“So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed</p>\n<p>and fear,” said rich dad. “Let me give you some examples. A doctor,</p>\n<p>wanting more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees.</p>\n<p>By raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>It hurts the poor people the most, so they have worse health than</p>\n<p>those with money. Because the doctors raise their fees, the attorneys</p>\n<p>raise their fees. Because the attorneys’ fees have gone up, schoolteachers</p>\n<p>want a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon there</p>\n<p>will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos</p>\n<p>will break out and another great civilization will collapse. History</p>\n<p>proves that great civilizations collapse when the gap between the haves</p>\n<p>and have-nots is too great. Sadly, America is on that same course</p>\n<p>because we haven’t learned from history. We only memorize historical</p>\n<p>dates and names, not the lesson.”</p>\n<p>“Aren’t prices supposed to go up?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“In an educated society with a well-run government, prices should</p>\n<p>actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory.</p>\n<p>Prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools</p>\n<p>taught people about money, there would be more money and lower</p>\n<p>prices. But schools focus only on teaching people to work for money,</p>\n<p>not how to harness money’s power.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t we have business schools?” Mike asked. “And haven’t</p>\n<p>you encouraged me to go for my MBA?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad. “But all too often business schools train</p>\n<p>employees to become sophisticated bean-counters. Heaven forbid a bean-</p>\n<p>counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire</p>\n<p>people, and kill the business. I know this because I hire bean-counters.</p>\n<p>All they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more</p>\n<p>problems. Bean-counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but</p>\n<p>it, too, is not the whole picture,” added rich dad angrily.</p>\n<p>“So is there an answer?” asked Mike.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad. “Learn to use your emotions to think, not</p>\n<p>think with your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions</p>\n<p>by agreeing to work for free, I knew there was hope. When you again</p>\n<p>resisted your emotions when I tempted you with more money, you</p>\n<p>were again learning to think in spite of being emotionally charged.</p>\n<p>That’s the first step.”</p>\n<p>“Why is that step so important?” I asked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I’ll take</p>\n<p>you boys into the briar patch, a place almost everyone else avoids. If</p>\n<p>you go with me, you’ll let go of the idea of working for money and</p>\n<p>instead learn to have money work for you.”</p>\n<p>“And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to</p>\n<p>learn from you? What will we get?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“The same thing Brer Rabbit got,” said rich dad, referring to the</p>\n<p>classic children’s story.</p>\n<p>“Is there a briar patch?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” said rich dad. “The briar patch is our fear and greed.</p>\n<p>Confronting fear, weaknesses, and neediness by choosing our own</p>\n<p>thoughts is the way out.”</p>\n<p>“Choosing our thoughts?” Mike asked, puzzled.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions.</p>\n<p>Instead of just getting up and going to work because not having the</p>\n<p>money to pay your bills is scaring you, ask yourself, ‘Is working harder</p>\n<p>at this the best solution to this problem?’ Most people are too afraid to</p>\n<p>rationally think things through and instead run out the door to a job</p>\n<p>they hate. The Tar Baby is in control. That’s what I mean by choosing</p>\n<p>your thoughts.”</p>\n<p>“And how do we do that?” Mike asked.</p>\n<p>“That’s what I will teach you. I’ll teach you to have a choice of</p>\n<p>thoughts rather than a knee-jerk reaction, like gulping down your</p>\n<p>morning coffee and running out the door.</p>\n<p>“Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term</p>\n<p>solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem</p>\n<p>in mind, and it’s short-term. It’s the bills at the end of the month,</p>\n<p>the Tar Baby. Money controls their lives, or should I say the fear and</p>\n<p>ignorance about money controls it. So they do as their parents did.</p>\n<p>They get up every day and go work for money, not taking the time to</p>\n<p>ask the question, ‘Is there another way?’ Their emotions now control</p>\n<p>their thinking, not their heads.”</p>\n<p>“Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the</p>\n<p>head thinking?” Mike asked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes. I hear it all the time,” said rich dad. “I hear things like,</p>\n<p>‘Well, everyone has to work.’ Or ‘The rich are crooks.’ Or ‘I’ll get</p>\n<p>another job. I deserve this raise. You can’t push me around.’ Or ‘I like</p>\n<p>this job because it’s secure.’ No one asks, ‘Is there something I’m</p>\n<p>missing here?’ which would break through the emotional thought</p>\n<p>and give you time to think clearly.”</p>\n<p>As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich</p>\n<p>really did “make money.” They did not work for it. He went on to</p>\n<p>explain that when Mike and I were casting five-cent pieces out of</p>\n<p>lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking</p>\n<p>the way the rich think. The problem was that creating money is legal</p>\n<p>for the government and banks to do, but illegal for us to do. There are</p>\n<p>legal ways to create money from nothing, he told us.</p>\n<p>Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an</p>\n<p>illusion, truly like the carrot for the donkey. It’s only out of fear and</p>\n<p>greed that the illusion of money is held together by billions of people</p>\n<p>who believe that money is real. It’s not. Money is really made up. It</p>\n<p>is only because of the illusion of confidence and the ignorance of the</p>\n<p>masses that this house of cards stands.</p>\n<p>He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that</p>\n<p>each dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him</p>\n<p>was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and</p>\n<p>our dollars would no longer be backed by something tangible.</p>\n<p>“If that happens, boys, all hell will break loose. The poor, the</p>\n<p>middle class, and the ignorant will have their lives ruined simply</p>\n<p>because they will continue to believe that money is real and that the</p>\n<p>company they work for, or the government, will look after them.”</p>\n<p>We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but</p>\n<h2>over the years, it made more and more sense.</h2>\n<h2>Seeing What Others Miss</h2>\n<p>As he climbed into his pickup truck outside his convenience store,</p>\n<p>rich dad said, “Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about</p>\n<p>needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of</p>\n<p>making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see</p>\n<p>things that other people never see. Most people never see these</p>\n<p>opportunities because they’re looking for money and security, so that’s</p>\n<p>all they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you’ll see them</p>\n<p>for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I’ll teach you</p>\n<p>something else. Learn this, and you’ll avoid one of life’s biggest traps.</p>\n<p>Mike and I picked up our things from the store and waved</p>\n<p>goodbye to Mrs. Martin. We went back to the park, to the same</p>\n<p>picnic bench, and spent several more hours thinking and talking.</p>\n<p>We spent the next week at school thinking and talking, too. For</p>\n<p>two more weeks, we kept thinking, talking, and working for free.</p>\n<p>At the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye</p>\n<p>to Mrs. Martin and looking at the comic-book stand with a longing</p>\n<p>gaze. The hard thing about not even getting 30 cents every Saturday</p>\n<p>was that I didn’t have any money to buy comic books. Suddenly, as</p>\n<p>Mrs. Martin said goodbye to Mike and me, I saw her do something I’d</p>\n<p>never seen her do before.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half.</p>\n<p>She kept the top half of the comic book cover and threw the rest of the</p>\n<p>book into a large cardboard box. When I asked her what she did with</p>\n<p>the comic books, she said, “I throw them away. I give the top half of</p>\n<p>the cover back to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings</p>\n<p>in the new comics. He’s coming in an hour.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived, and</p>\n<p>I asked him if we could have the comic books. To my delight, he said,</p>\n<p>“You can have them if you work for this store and do not resell them.”</p>\n<p>Remember our old business partnership? Well, Mike and I revived</p>\n<p>it. Using a spare room in Mike’s basement, we began piling hundreds</p>\n<p>of comic books in that room. Soon our comic-book library was open</p>\n<p>to the public. We hired Mike’s younger sister, who loved to study, to be</p>\n<p>head librarian. She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library,</p>\n<p>which was open from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day after school.</p>\n<p>The customers, the children of the neighborhood, could read as many</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter One: Lesson 1</p>\n<p>comics as they wanted in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a</p>\n<p>comic cost 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours.</p>\n<p>Mike’s sister would check the kids as they left to make sure they</p>\n<p>weren’t borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging</p>\n<p>in how many kids showed up each day, who they were, and any</p>\n<p>comments they might have. Mike and I averaged $9.50 per week</p>\n<p>over a three-month period. We paid his sister one dollar a week and</p>\n<p>allowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she</p>\n<p>was always studying.</p>\n<p>Mike and I kept our agreement by working in the store every</p>\n<p>Saturday and collecting all the comic books from the different stores.</p>\n<p>We kept our agreement to the distributor by not selling any comic</p>\n<p>books. We burned them once they got too tattered. We tried opening</p>\n<p>a branch office, but we could never quite find someone as trustworthy</p>\n<p>and dedicated as Mike’s sister. At an early age, we found out how hard</p>\n<p>it was to find good staff.</p>\n<p>Three months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in</p>\n<p>the room. Some bullies from another neighborhood pushed their</p>\n<p>way in, and Mike’s dad suggested we shut down the business. So</p>\n<p>our comic-book business shut down, and we stopped working on</p>\n<p>Saturdays at the convenience store. But rich dad was excited because</p>\n<p>he had new things he wanted to teach us. He was happy because we</p>\n<p>had learned our first lesson so well: We learned to make money work</p>\n<p>for us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced</p>\n<p>to use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money.</p>\n<p>By starting our own business, the comic-book library, we were in</p>\n<p>control of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. The best</p>\n<p>part was that our business generated money for us, even when we</p>\n<p>weren’t physically there. Our money worked for us.</p>\n<p>Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much more.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Two</h2>\n<h2>LESSON       2:  WHY      TEACH</h2>\n<h2>FINANCIAL          LITERACY?</h2>\n<h2>It’s not how much money you make.</h2>\n<h2>It’s how much money you keep.</h2>\n<p>In 1990, Mike took over his father’s empire and is, in fact,</p>\n<p>doing a better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice</p>\n<p>a year on the golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you</p>\n<p>could imagine. Rich dad’s empire is in great hands, and Mike is now</p>\n<p>grooming his son to take his place, as his dad had groomed us.</p>\n<p>In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife Kim was 37.</p>\n<p>Retirement does not mean not working. For us, it means that, barring</p>\n<p>unforeseen cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our</p>\n<p>wealth grows automatically, staying ahead of inflation. Our assets</p>\n<p>are large enough to grow by themselves. It’s like planting a tree. You</p>\n<p>water it for years, and then one day it doesn’t need you anymore. Its</p>\n<p>roots are implanted deep enough. Then the tree provides shade for</p>\n<p>your enjoyment.</p>\n<p>Mike chose to run the empire, and I chose to retire.</p>\n<p>Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would</p>\n<p>recommend that they do. “How do I get started?” “Is there a book</p>\n<p>you would recommend?” “What should I do to prepare my children?”</p>\n<p>“What is your secret to success?” “How do I make millions?”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>Whenever I hear one of these questions, I’m reminded of the</p>\n<p>following story:</p>\n<p>The Richest Businessmen</p>\n<p>In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen</p>\n<p>held a meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among</p>\n<p>them were Charles Schwab, head of the largest independent steel</p>\n<p>company; Samuel Insull, president of the world’s largest utility;</p>\n<p>Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar Kreuger,</p>\n<p>president of International Match Co., one of the world’s largest</p>\n<p>companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of</p>\n<p>International Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the</p>\n<p>New York Stock Exchange; Arthur Cotton and Jesse Livermore,</p>\n<p>two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert Fall, a member of</p>\n<p>President Harding’s cabinet. Twenty-five years later, nine of these</p>\n<p>titans ended their lives as follows: Schwab died penniless after</p>\n<p>living for five years on borrowed money. Insull died broke in a</p>\n<p>foreign land, and Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson</p>\n<p>went insane. Whitney and Albert Fall were released from prison,</p>\n<p>and Fraser and Livermore committed suicide.</p>\n<p>I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men.</p>\n<p>If you look at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash</p>\n<p>and the Great Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on</p>\n<p>these men and their lives. The point is this: Today we live in times of</p>\n<p>greater and faster change than these men did. I suspect there will be</p>\n<p>many booms and busts in the coming years that will parallel the ups</p>\n<p>and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many people</p>\n<p>are too focused on money and not on their greatest wealth, their</p>\n<p>education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind</p>\n<p>and learn, they will grow richer and richer despite tough changes.</p>\n<p>If they think money will solve problems, they will have a rough ride.</p>\n<p>Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without</p>\n<p>financial intelligence is money soon gone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Most people fail to realize that in life, it’s not how much money</p>\n<p>you make. It’s how much money you keep. We’ve all heard stories</p>\n<p>of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, and then poor</p>\n<p>again. They win millions, yet are soon back where they started. Or</p>\n<p>stories of professional athletes, who at the age of 24 are earning</p>\n<p>millions, but are sleeping under a bridge 10 years later.</p>\n<p>I remember a story of a young basketball player who a year ago</p>\n<p>had millions. Today, at just 29, he claims his friends, attorney, and</p>\n<p>accountant took his money, and he was forced to work at a car</p>\n<p>wash for minimum wage. He was fired from the car wash because</p>\n<p>he refused to take off his championship ring as he was wiping off</p>\n<p>the cars. His story made national news and he is appealing his</p>\n<p>termination, claiming hardship and discrimination. He claims that</p>\n<p>the ring is all he has left and if it was stripped away, he’ll crumble.</p>\n<p>I know so many people who became instant millionaires. And</p>\n<p>while I am glad some people have become richer and richer, I caution</p>\n<p>them that in the long run, it’s not how much money you make. It’s</p>\n<p>how much you keep, and how many generations you keep it.</p>\n<p>So when people ask, “Where do I get started?” or “Tell me how to</p>\n<p>get rich quick,” they often are greatly disappointed with my answer.</p>\n<p>I simply say to them what my rich dad said to me when I was a little</p>\n<p>kid. “If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.”</p>\n<p>That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together.</p>\n<p>As I said, my educated dad stressed the importance of reading books,</p>\n<p>while my rich dad stressed the need to master financial literacy.</p>\n<p>If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing</p>\n<p>you need to do is dig a deep hole and pour a strong foundation. If</p>\n<p>you are going to build a home in the suburbs, all you need to do is</p>\n<p>pour a six-inch slab of concrete. Most people, in their drive to get</p>\n<p>rich, are trying to build an Empire State Building on a six-inch slab.</p>\n<p>Our school system, created in the Agrarian Age, still believes</p>\n<p>in homes with no foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids</p>\n<p>graduate from school with virtually no financial foundation. One day,</p>\n<p>sleepless and deep in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream,</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>they decide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a</p>\n<p>way to get rich quick.</p>\n<p>Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon,</p>\n<p>instead of the Empire State Building, we have the Leaning Tower of</p>\n<p>Suburbia. The sleepless nights return.</p>\n<p>As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were</p>\n<p>possible because we were taught to pour a strong financial foundation</p>\n<p>when we were just kids.</p>\n<p>Accounting is possibly the most confusing, boring subject in the</p>\n<p>world, but if you want to be rich long-term, it could be the most</p>\n<p>important subject. For rich dad, the question was how to take a boring</p>\n<p>and confusing subject and teach it to kids. The answer he found was to</p>\n<p>make it simple by teaching it in pictures.</p>\n<p>My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me.</p>\n<p>Since we were just kids, he created a simple way to teach us.</p>\n<p>For years he only drew pictures and used few words. Mike and I</p>\n<p>understood the simple drawings, the jargon, the movement of money,</p>\n<p>and then in later years, rich dad began</p>\n<p>Rich people acquire adding numbers. Today, Mike has gone</p>\n<p>assets. The poor and on to master much more complex and</p>\n<p>middle class acquire sophisticated accounting analysis because</p>\n<p>liabilities that they he had to in order to run his empire. I am</p>\n<p>think are assets. not as sophisticated because my empire</p>\n<p>is smaller, yet we come from the same</p>\n<p>simple foundation. Over the following pages, I offer to you the same</p>\n<p>simple line drawings Mike’s dad created for us. Though basic, those</p>\n<p>drawings helped guide two little boys in building great sums of wealth</p>\n<p>on a solid and deep foundation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Rule #1: You must know the difference between an asset</p>\n<h2>and a liability, and buy assets.</h2>\n<p>If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is rule number</p>\n<p>one. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most</p>\n<p>people have no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle</p>\n<p>financially because they do not know the difference between an asset</p>\n<p>and a liability.</p>\n<p>“Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire</p>\n<p>liabilities that they think are assets,” said rich dad.</p>\n<p>When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he</p>\n<p>was kidding. Here we were, nearly teenagers and waiting for the</p>\n<p>secret to getting rich, and this was his answer. It was so simple that</p>\n<p>we stopped for a long time to think about it.</p>\n<p>“What is an asset?” asked Mike.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry right now,” said rich dad. “Just let the idea sink in.</p>\n<p>If you can comprehend the simplicity, your life will have a plan and</p>\n<p>be financially easy. It is simple. That is why the idea is missed.”</p>\n<p>“You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them,</p>\n<p>and we’ll be rich?” I asked.</p>\n<p>Rich dad nodded his head. “It’s that simple.”</p>\n<p>“If it’s that simple, how come everyone is not rich?” I asked.</p>\n<p>Rich dad smiled. “Because people do not know the difference</p>\n<p>between an asset and a liability.”</p>\n<p>I remember asking, “How could adults be so misguided? If it is</p>\n<p>that simple, if it is that important, why would everyone not want to</p>\n<p>find out?”</p>\n<p>It took rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and</p>\n<h2>liabilities were.</h2>\n<p>As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. The</p>\n<p>simplicity of the idea escapes them because they have been educated</p>\n<p>differently. They were taught by other educated professionals, such</p>\n<p>as bankers, accountants, real estate agents, financial planners, and so</p>\n<p>forth. The difficulty comes in asking adults to unlearn, or become</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is demeaning to</p>\n<p>pay attention to simplistic definitions.</p>\n<p>Rich dad believed in the KISS principle—Keep It Simple,</p>\n<p>Stupid (or Keep It Super Simple)—so he kept it simple for us, and</p>\n<p>that made our financial foundation strong.</p>\n<p>So what causes the confusion? How could something so simple</p>\n<p>be so screwed up? Why would someone buy an asset that was really</p>\n<p>a liability? The answer is found in basic education.</p>\n<p>We focus on the word “literacy” and not “financial literacy.”</p>\n<p>What defines something to be an asset or a liability are not words.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words “asset”</p>\n<p>and “liability” in the dictionary. I know</p>\n<p>An asset puts money the definition may sound good to a</p>\n<p>in my pocket.  trained accountant, but for the average</p>\n<p>A liability takes money person, it makes no sense. But we</p>\n<p>out of my pocket. adults are often too proud to admit that</p>\n<p>something does not make sense.</p>\n<p>To us young boys, rich dad said, “What defines an asset are not</p>\n<p>words, but numbers. And if you can’t read the numbers, you can’t tell</p>\n<p>an asset from a hole in the ground.” “In accounting,” rich dad would</p>\n<p>say, “it’s not the numbers, but what the numbers are telling you. It’s just</p>\n<p>like words. It’s not the words, but the story the words are telling you.”</p>\n<p>“If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand</p>\n<p>numbers.” If I heard that once, I heard it a thousand times from my</p>\n<p>rich dad. And I also heard, “The rich acquire assets, and the poor and</p>\n<p>middle class acquire liabilities.”</p>\n<p>Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability.</p>\n<p>Most accountants and financial professionals do not agree with</p>\n<p>the definitions, but these simple drawings were the start of strong</p>\n<p>financial foundations for two young boys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<h2>This is the cash-flow pattern of an asset:</h2>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>The top part of the diagram is an Income Statement, often called</p>\n<p>a Profit-and-Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses: money</p>\n<p>in and money out. The lower part of the diagram is a Balance Sheet.</p>\n<p>It’s called that because it’s supposed to balance assets against liabilities.</p>\n<p>Many financial novices do not know the relationship between the</p>\n<p>Income Statement and the Balance Sheet, and it is vital to understand</p>\n<p>that relationship.</p>\n<p>So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that</p>\n<p>“assets put money in your pocket.” Nice, simple, and usable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<h2>This is the cash-flow pattern of a liability:</h2>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE  SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures,</p>\n<p>it may be easier to understand my definitions in words. An asset is</p>\n<p>something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something</p>\n<p>that takes money out of my pocket. This is really all you need to</p>\n<p>know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If</p>\n<p>you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities.</p>\n<p>Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of</p>\n<p>financial struggle. If people are having difficulties financially, there is</p>\n<p>something that they don’t understand, either in words or numbers.</p>\n<p>The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas</p>\n<p>than people who struggle financially. So if you want to be rich and</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>maintain your wealth, it’s important to be financially literate, in words</p>\n<p>as well as numbers.</p>\n<p>The arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or “cash</p>\n<p>flow.” Numbers alone mean little, just as words out of context</p>\n<p>mean little. It’s the story that counts. In financial reporting, reading</p>\n<p>numbers is looking for the plot, the story of where the cash is flowing.</p>\n<p>In 80 percent of most families, the financial story paints a picture of</p>\n<p>hard work to get ahead. However, this effort is for naught because</p>\n<p>they spend their lives buying liabilities instead of assets.</p>\n<h2>This is the cash-flow pattern of a poor person:</h2>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Job</p>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Rent</p>\n<p>Food</p>\n<p>Transportation</p>\n<p>Clothes</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>This is the cash-flow pattern of a person in the middle class:</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Job    Income</p>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Mortgage Payment</p>\n<p>Car Payment</p>\n<p>Credit Card Payment</p>\n<p>School Loan Payment</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>Mortgage</p>\n<p>Car Loans</p>\n<p>Credit Card Debt</p>\n<p>School Loans</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<h2>This is the cash-flow pattern of a rich person:</h2>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Rental Income</p>\n<p>Dividend</p>\n<p>Interest</p>\n<p>Royalties</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Mortgage Payment</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>Real Estate Mortgage</p>\n<p>Stocks      Consumer Loans</p>\n<p>Bonds       Credit Cards</p>\n<p>Notes</p>\n<p>Intellectual</p>\n<p>Property</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>All of these diagrams are obviously oversimplified. Everyone has</p>\n<p>living expenses, the need for food, shelter, and clothing. The diagrams</p>\n<p>show the flow of cash through a poor, middle-class, and wealthy</p>\n<p>person’s life. It is the cash flow that tells the story of how a person</p>\n<p>handles their money.</p>\n<p>The reason I started with the story of the richest men in America</p>\n<p>is to illustrate the flaw in believing that money will solve all problems.</p>\n<p>That is why I cringe whenever I hear people ask me how to get rich</p>\n<p>quicker, or where they should start. I often hear, “I’m in debt, so I need</p>\n<p>to make more money.”</p>\n<p>But more money will often not solve the problem. In fact, it may</p>\n<p>compound the problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human</p>\n<p>flaws, putting a spotlight on what we</p>\n<p>Cash flow tells the don’t know. That is why, all too often, a</p>\n<p>story of how a person person who comes into a sudden windfall</p>\n<p>handles money.  of cash—let’s say an inheritance, a pay</p>\n<p>raise, or lottery winnings—soon returns</p>\n<p>to the same financial mess, if not worse, than the mess they were in</p>\n<p>before. Money only accentuates the cash-flow pattern running in your</p>\n<p>head. If your pattern is to spend everything you get, most likely an</p>\n<p>increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending. Thus, the</p>\n<p>saying, “A fool and his money is one big party.”</p>\n<p>I have said many times that we go to school to gain scholastic</p>\n<p>and professional skills, both of which are important. We learn to</p>\n<p>make money with our professional skills. In the 1960s when I was in</p>\n<p>high school, if someone did well academically, people assumed this</p>\n<p>bright student would go on to be a medical doctor because it was the</p>\n<p>profession with the promise of the greatest financial reward.</p>\n<p>Today, doctors face financial challenges I wouldn’t wish on my</p>\n<p>worst enemy: insurance companies taking control of the business,</p>\n<p>managed health care, government intervention, and malpractice suits.</p>\n<p>Today, kids want to be famous athletes, movie stars, rock stars, beauty</p>\n<p>queens, or CEOs because that is where the fame, money, and prestige</p>\n<p>are. That is the reason it is so hard to motivate kids in school today.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>They know that professional success is no longer solely linked to</p>\n<p>academic success, as it once was.</p>\n<p>Because students leave school without financial skills, millions</p>\n<p>of educated people pursue their profession successfully, but later find</p>\n<p>themselves struggling financially. They work harder but don’t get ahead.</p>\n<p>What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but</p>\n<p>how to manage money. It’s called financial aptitude—what you do with</p>\n<p>the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from</p>\n<p>you, how to keep it longer, and how to make that money work hard</p>\n<p>for you. Most people don’t understand why they struggle financially</p>\n<p>because they don’t understand cash flow. A person can be highly</p>\n<p>educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate. These</p>\n<p>people often work harder than they need to because they learned how</p>\n<p>to work hard, but not how to have their money work hard for them.</p>\n<h2>How  the Quest for a Financial Dream Turns into a</h2>\n<h2>Financial Nightmare</h2>\n<p>The classic story of hardworking people has a set pattern. Recently</p>\n<p>married, the happy, highly educated young couple moves into one of</p>\n<p>their cramped rented apartments. Immediately, they realize that they</p>\n<p>are saving money because two can live as cheaply as one.</p>\n<p>The problem is the apartment is cramped. They decide to save</p>\n<p>money to buy their dream home so they can have kids. They now have</p>\n<p>two incomes, and they begin to focus on their careers. Their incomes</p>\n<p>begin to increase.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>As their incomes go up, their expenses go up as well.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>The number-one expense for most people is taxes. Many people</p>\n<p>think it’s income tax, but for most Americans, their highest tax is</p>\n<p>Social Security. As an employee, it appears as if the Social Security tax</p>\n<p>combined with the Medicare tax rate is roughly 7.5 percent, but it’s</p>\n<p>really 15 percent since the employer must match the Social Security</p>\n<p>amount. In essence, it is money the employer can’t pay you. On top</p>\n<p>of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount deducted from</p>\n<p>your wages for Social Security tax, income you never received because</p>\n<p>it went directly to Social Security through withholding.</p>\n<p>Going back to the young couple, as a result of their incomes</p>\n<p>increasing, they decide to buy the house of their dreams. Once in</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>their house, they have a new tax, called property tax. Then they buy</p>\n<p>a new car, new furniture, and new appliances to match their new</p>\n<p>house. All of a sudden, they wake up and their liabilities column is</p>\n<p>full of mortgage and credit-card debt. Their liabilities go up.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>They’re now trapped in the Rat Race. Pretty soon a baby comes</p>\n<p>along and they work harder. The process repeats itself: Higher</p>\n<p>incomes cause higher taxes, also called “bracket creep.” A credit</p>\n<p>card comes in the mail. They use it and max it out. A loan company</p>\n<p>calls and says their greatest “asset,” their home, has appreciated in</p>\n<p>value. Because their credit is so good, the company offers a bill-</p>\n<p>consolidation loan and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>off the high-interest consumer debt by paying off their credit card. And</p>\n<p>besides, interest on their home is a tax deduction. They go for it, and</p>\n<p>pay off those high-interest credit cards. They breathe a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Their credit cards are paid off. They’ve now folded their consumer</p>\n<p>debt into their home mortgage. Their payments go down because they</p>\n<p>extend their debt over 30 years. It is the smart thing to do.</p>\n<p>Their neighbor calls to invite them to go shopping. The Memorial</p>\n<p>Day sale is on. They promise themselves they’ll just window shop, but</p>\n<p>they take a credit card, just in case.</p>\n<p>I run into this young couple all the time. Their names change, but</p>\n<p>their financial dilemma is the same. They come to one of my talks to</p>\n<p>hear what I have to say. They ask me, “Can you tell us how to make</p>\n<p>more money?”</p>\n<p>They don’t understand that their trouble is really how they choose</p>\n<p>to spend the money they do have. It is caused by financial illiteracy</p>\n<p>and not understanding the difference between an asset and a liability.</p>\n<p>More money seldom solves someone’s money problems.</p>\n<p>Intelligence solves problems. There is a saying a friend of mine says</p>\n<p>over and over to people in debt: “If you find you have dug yourself</p>\n<p>into a hole... stop digging.”</p>\n<p>As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware</p>\n<p>of three powers: the power of the sword, the jewel, and the mirror.</p>\n<p>The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent</p>\n<p>trillions of dollars on weapons and, because of this, is a powerful</p>\n<p>military presence in the world.</p>\n<p>The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree</p>\n<p>of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the</p>\n<p>gold makes the rules.”</p>\n<p>The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-</p>\n<p>knowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured</p>\n<p>of the three.</p>\n<p>All too often, the poor and middle class allow the power of</p>\n<p>money to control them. By simply getting up and working harder,</p>\n<p>failing to ask themselves if what they do makes sense, they shoot</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>themselves in the foot as they leave for work every morning. By not</p>\n<p>fully understanding money, the vast majority of people allow its</p>\n<p>awesome power to control them.</p>\n<p>If they used the power of the mirror, they would have asked</p>\n<p>themselves, “Does this make sense?” All too often, instead of trusting</p>\n<p>their inner wisdom, that genius inside, most people follow the crowd.</p>\n<p>They do things because everybody else does them. They conform,</p>\n<p>rather than question. Often, they mindlessly repeat what they have</p>\n<p>been told: “Diversify.” “Your home is an asset.” “Your home is your</p>\n<p>biggest investment.” “You get a tax break for going into greater debt.”</p>\n<p>“Get a safe job.” “Don’t make mistakes.” “Don’t take risks.”</p>\n<p>It is said that the fear of public</p>\n<h2>A person can be highly</h2>\n<p>speaking is a fear greater than</p>\n<p>educated, professionally death for most people. According</p>\n<p>successful, and to psychiatrists, the fear of public</p>\n<p>financially illiterate. speaking is caused by the fear of</p>\n<p>ostracism, the fear of standing out, the</p>\n<p>fear of criticism, the fear of ridicule, and the fear of being an outcast.</p>\n<p>The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new</p>\n<p>ways to solve their problems.</p>\n<p>That is why my educated dad said the Japanese valued the power</p>\n<p>of the mirror the most, for it is only when we look into it that we find</p>\n<p>truth. Fear is the main reason that people say, “Play it safe.” That goes</p>\n<p>for anything, be it sports, relationships, careers, or money.</p>\n<p>It is that same fear, the fear of ostracism, that causes people to</p>\n<p>conform to, and not question, commonly accepted opinions or</p>\n<p>popular trends: “Your home is an asset.” “Get a bill-consolidation</p>\n<p>loan, and get out of debt.” “Work harder.” “It’s a promotion.”</p>\n<p>“Someday I’ll be a vice president.” “Save money.” “When I get a raise,</p>\n<p>I’ll buy us a bigger house.” “Mutual funds are safe.”</p>\n<p>Many financial problems are caused by trying to keep up with the</p>\n<p>Joneses. Occasionally, we all need to look in the mirror and be true to</p>\n<p>our inner wisdom rather than our fears.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>By the time Mike and I were 16 years old, we began to have</p>\n<p>problems in school. We were not bad kids. We just began to separate</p>\n<p>from the crowd. We worked for Mike’s dad after school and on</p>\n<p>weekends. Mike and I often spent hours after work just sitting at a</p>\n<p>table with his dad while he held meetings with his bankers, attorneys,</p>\n<p>accountants, brokers, investors, managers, and employees. Here was</p>\n<p>a man who had left school at 13 who was now directing, instructing,</p>\n<p>ordering, and asking questions of educated people. They came at his</p>\n<p>beck and call, and cringed when he didn’t approve of them.</p>\n<p>Here was a man who had not gone along with the crowd. He was</p>\n<p>a man who did his own thinking and detested the words, “We have</p>\n<p>to do it this way because that’s the way everyone else does it.” He also</p>\n<p>hated the word “can’t.” If you wanted him to do something, just say,</p>\n<p>“I don’t think you can do it.”</p>\n<p>Mike and I learned more sitting in on his meetings than we did</p>\n<p>in all our years of school, college included. Mike’s dad was not book-</p>\n<p>smart, but he was financially educated and successful as a result. He</p>\n<p>told us over and over again, “An intelligent person hires people who</p>\n<p>are more intelligent than he is.” So Mike and I had the benefit of</p>\n<p>spending hours listening to and learning from intelligent people.</p>\n<p>But because of this, Mike and I couldn’t go along with the</p>\n<p>standard dogma our teachers preached, and that caused problems.</p>\n<p>Whenever the teacher said, “If you don’t get good grades, you won’t</p>\n<p>do well in the real world,” Mike and I just raised our eyebrows.</p>\n<p>When we were told to follow set procedures and not deviate from the</p>\n<p>rules, we could see how school discouraged creativity. We started to</p>\n<p>understand why our rich dad told us that schools were designed to</p>\n<p>produce good employees, instead of employers. Occasionally, Mike</p>\n<p>or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was applicable in</p>\n<p>the real world, or why we never studied money and how it worked.</p>\n<p>To the latter question, we often got the answer that money was not</p>\n<p>important, that if we excelled in our education, the money would</p>\n<p>follow. The more we knew about the power of money, the more</p>\n<p>distant we grew from the teachers and our classmates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>My highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades, but</p>\n<p>we did begin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I probably</p>\n<p>had a far better foundation with money than both my parents. I could</p>\n<p>keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate attorneys, bankers,</p>\n<p>real estate brokers, investors, and so forth. By contrast, my dad talked</p>\n<p>to other teachers.</p>\n<p>One day my dad told me that our home was his greatest investment.</p>\n<p>A not-too-pleasant argument took place when I showed him why I</p>\n<p>thought a house was not a good investment.</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets    Liabilities</p>\n<p>RICH DAD</p>\n<p>Home</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets   Liabilities</p>\n<p>POOR DAD</p>\n<p>Home</p>\n<p>The above diagram illustrates the difference in perception between</p>\n<p>my rich dad and my poor dad when it came to their homes. One</p>\n<p>dad thought his house was an asset, and the other dad thought it was</p>\n<p>a liability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>I remember when I drew the following diagram for my dad showing</p>\n<p>him the direction of cash flow. I also showed him the ancillary</p>\n<p>expenses that went along with owning the home. A bigger home</p>\n<p>meant bigger expenses, and the cash flow kept going out through</p>\n<p>the expense column.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Mortgage Payment</p>\n<p>Property Tax</p>\n<p>Insurance</p>\n<p>Maintenance</p>\n<p>Utilities</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets    Liabilities</p>\n<p>Mortgage</p>\n<p>Today, people still challenge me on the idea of a house not being</p>\n<p>an asset. I know that for many people, it is their dream as well as</p>\n<p>their largest investment. And owning your own home is better than</p>\n<p>nothing. I simply offer an alternate way of looking at this popular</p>\n<p>dogma. If my wife and I were to buy a bigger, flashier house, we</p>\n<p>realize it wouldn’t be an asset. It would be a liability since it would</p>\n<p>take money out of our pocket.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>So here is the argument I put forth. I really don’t expect most</p>\n<p>people to agree with it because your home is an emotional thing</p>\n<p>and when it comes to money, high emotions tend to lower financial</p>\n<p>intelligence. I know from personal experience that money has a way</p>\n<p>of making every decision emotional.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it comes to houses, most people work all their</li>\n</ul>\n<p>lives paying for a home they never own. In other words,</p>\n<p>most people buy a new house every few years, each time</p>\n<p>incurring a new 30-year loan to pay off the previous one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though people receive a tax deduction for interest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>on mortgage payments, they pay for all their other</p>\n<p>expenses with after-tax dollars, even after they pay off</p>\n<p>their mortgage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My wife’s parents were shocked when the property taxes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>on their home increased to $1,000 a month. This was</p>\n<p>after they had retired, so the increase put a strain on their</p>\n<p>retirement budget, and they felt forced to move.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Houses do not always go up in value. I have friends who</li>\n</ul>\n<p>owe a million dollars for a home that today would sell</p>\n<p>for far less.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If all your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced</p>\n<p>to work harder because your money continues blowing</p>\n<p>out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset</p>\n<p>column—the classic middle-class cash-flow pattern. If a</p>\n<p>young couple would put more money into their asset column</p>\n<p>early on, their later years would be easier. Their assets would</p>\n<p>have grown and would be available to help cover expenses.</p>\n<p>All too often, a house only serves as a vehicle for incurring a</p>\n<h2>home-equity loan to pay for mounting expenses.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>In summary, the end result in making a decision to own a house</p>\n<p>that is too expensive in lieu of starting an investment portfolio impacts</p>\n<p>an individual in at least the following three ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>in value.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested</li>\n</ul>\n<p>instead of paying for high-maintenance expenses related</p>\n<p>directly to the home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loss of education. Too often, people count their house</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and savings and retirement plans as all they have in their</p>\n<p>asset column. Because they have no money to invest, they</p>\n<p>simply don’t invest. This costs them investment experience.</p>\n<p>Most never become what the investment world calls “a</p>\n<p>sophisticated investor.” And the best investments are usually</p>\n<p>first sold to sophisticated investors, who then turn around</p>\n<p>and sell them to the people playing it safe.</p>\n<p>I am not saying don’t buy a house. What I am saying is that you</p>\n<p>should understand the difference between an asset and a liability.</p>\n<p>When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the</p>\n<p>cash flow to pay for the house.</p>\n<p>My educated dad’s personal financial statement best demonstrates</p>\n<p>the life of someone caught in the Rat Race. His expenses match his</p>\n<p>income, never allowing him enough left over to invest in assets. As a</p>\n<p>result, his liabilities are larger than his assets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>The following diagram on the left shows my poor dad’s income</p>\n<p>statement. It is worth a thousand words. It shows that his income and</p>\n<p>expenses are equal while his liabilities are larger than his assets.</p>\n<p>My rich dad’s personal financial statement on the right reflects the</p>\n<p>results of a life dedicated to investing and minimizing liabilities.</p>\n<h2>Poor Dad’s             Rich Dad’s</h2>\n<h2>Financial Statement    Financial Statement</h2>\n<p>PPoooorr DDaadd’s’s FFiinnaanncciiaall SSttaatteemmeenntt RRiicchh DDaadd’s’s FFiinnaanncciiaall SSttaatteemmeenntt</p>\n<p>IInnccoommee           IInnccoommee</p>\n<p>EExxppeennsseess</p>\n<p>EExxppeennsseess</p>\n<p>AAsssseettss LLiiaabbiilliittiieess AAsssseettss LLiiaabbiilliittiieess</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<h2>Why  the Rich Get Richer</h2>\n<p>A review of my rich dad’s financial statement shows why the rich</p>\n<p>get richer. The asset column generates more than enough income to</p>\n<p>cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. The</p>\n<p>asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces</p>\n<p>grows with it. The result is that the rich get richer!</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE  SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets       Liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<h2>Why  the Middle Class Struggle</h2>\n<p>The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle.</p>\n<p>Their primary income is through their salary. As their wages increase,</p>\n<p>so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in proportion to their</p>\n<p>salary increase: hence, the phrase “the Rat Race.” They treat their home</p>\n<p>as their primary asset, instead of investing in income-producing assets.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>This pattern of treating your home as an investment, and the</p>\n<p>philosophy that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend</p>\n<p>more, is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. Increased</p>\n<p>spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial</p>\n<p>uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and</p>\n<p>receiving raises on a regular basis. This is high-risk living caused by</p>\n<p>weak financial education.</p>\n<p>The massive loss of jobs in recent times proves how shaky the</p>\n<p>middle class really is financially. Company pension plans are being</p>\n<p>replaced by 401(k) plans. Social Security is obviously in trouble and</p>\n<p>can’t be relied upon as a source for retirement. Panic has set in for</p>\n<p>the middle class.</p>\n<p>Today, mutual funds are popular because they supposedly</p>\n<p>represent safety. Average mutual-fund buyers are too busy working to</p>\n<p>pay taxes and mortgages, save for their children’s college, and pay off</p>\n<p>credit cards. They do not have time to study investing, so they rely</p>\n<p>on the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund. Also, because the</p>\n<p>mutual fund includes many different types of investments, they feel</p>\n<p>their money is safer because it is “diversified.” This educated middle</p>\n<p>class subscribes to the dogma put out by mutual-fund brokers and</p>\n<p>financial planners: “Play it safe. Avoid risk.”</p>\n<p>The real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what</p>\n<p>creates the risk faced by average middle-class people. The reason they have</p>\n<p>to play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best. Their</p>\n<p>balance sheets are not balanced. Instead, they are loaded with liabilities</p>\n<p>and have no real assets that generate income. Typically, their only source</p>\n<p>of income is their paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent</p>\n<p>on their employer. So when genuine “deals of a lifetime” come along,</p>\n<p>these people can’t take advantage of them because they are working so</p>\n<p>hard, are taxed to the max, and are loaded with debt.</p>\n<p>As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule</p>\n<p>is to know the difference between an asset and a liability. Once</p>\n<p>you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on buying</p>\n<p>income-generating assets. That’s the best way to get started on a path</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>to becoming rich. Keep doing that, and your asset column will grow.</p>\n<p>Keep liabilities and expenses down so more money is available to</p>\n<p>continue pouring into the asset column. Soon the asset base will be</p>\n<p>so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments:</p>\n<p>investments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity;</p>\n<p>$5,000 investments that are soon turned into $1 million or more;</p>\n<p>investments that the middle class calls “too risky.” The investment is</p>\n<p>not risky for the financially literate.</p>\n<p>If you do what the masses do, you get the following picture:</p>\n<p>INCOME  STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Work for the Company</p>\n<p>(Salary)</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Work for the Government</p>\n<p>(Taxes)</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets    Liabilities</p>\n<p>Work for the Bank</p>\n<p>(Mortgage)</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts</p>\n<p>are generally as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You work for the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Employees make their business owner or the shareholders</p>\n<p>rich, not themselves. Your efforts and success will help</p>\n<p>provide for the owner’s success and retirement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You work for the government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The government takes its share from your paycheck before</p>\n<p>you even see it. By working harder, you simply increase the</p>\n<p>amount of taxes taken by the government. Most people</p>\n<p>work from January to May just for the government.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You work for the bank.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After taxes, your next largest expense is usually your</p>\n<p>mortgage and credit-card debt.</p>\n<p>The problem with simply working harder is that each of these</p>\n<p>three levels takes a greater share of your increased efforts. You need to</p>\n<p>learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and your family</p>\n<p>directly.</p>\n<p>Once you have decided to concentrate on minding your own</p>\n<p>business—focusing your efforts on acquiring assets instead of a bigger</p>\n<p>paycheck—how do you set your goals? Most people must keep their</p>\n<p>job and rely on their wages to fund their acquisition of assets.</p>\n<p>As their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their</p>\n<p>success? When does someone know that they are rich, that they</p>\n<p>have wealth?</p>\n<p>As well as having my own definitions for assets and liabilities,</p>\n<p>I also have my own definition for wealth. Actually, I borrowed it from</p>\n<p>a man named R. Buckminster Fuller. Some call him a quack, and</p>\n<p>others call him a genius. Years ago he got architects buzzing because</p>\n<p>he applied for a patent for something called a geodesic dome. But in</p>\n<p>the application, Fuller also said something about wealth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>It was pretty confusing at first, but after reading it, it began to make</p>\n<p>some sense:</p>\n<p>Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many number of days</p>\n<p>forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?</p>\n<p>Unlike net worth—the difference between your assets and liabilities,</p>\n<p>which is often filled with a person’s expensive junk and opinions of what</p>\n<p>things are worth—this definition creates the possibility for developing</p>\n<p>a truly accurate measurement. I could now measure and know where I</p>\n<p>was in terms of my goal to become financially independent.</p>\n<p>Although net worth often includes non-cash-producing assets, like</p>\n<p>stuff you bought that now sits in your garage, wealth measures how</p>\n<p>much money your money is making and, therefore, your financial</p>\n<p>survivability.</p>\n<p>Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column</p>\n<p>compared with the expense column.</p>\n<p>Let’s use an example. Let’s say I have cash flow from my asset</p>\n<p>column of $1,000 a month. And I have monthly expenses of $2,000.</p>\n<p>What is my wealth?</p>\n<p>Let’s go back to Buckminster Fuller’s definition. Using his</p>\n<p>definition, how many days forward can I survive? Assuming a 30-day</p>\n<p>month, I have enough cash flow for half a month.</p>\n<p>When I achieve $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then</p>\n<p>I will be wealthy.</p>\n<p>So while I’m not yet rich, I am wealthy. I now have income</p>\n<p>generated from assets each month that fully cover my monthly</p>\n<p>expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my</p>\n<p>cash flow to maintain this level of wealth. Also note that it is at this</p>\n<p>point that I’m no longer dependent on my wages. I have focused on,</p>\n<p>and been successful in, building an asset column that has made me</p>\n<p>financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to</p>\n<p>cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.</p>\n<p>My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my</p>\n<p>assets reinvested into the asset column. The more money that goes</p>\n<p>into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. The more</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Two: Lesson 2</p>\n<p>my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my</p>\n<p>expenses less than the cash flow from these assets, I grow richer with</p>\n<p>more and more income from sources other than my physical labor.</p>\n<p>As this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to</p>\n<p>becoming rich. Just remember this simple observation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The rich buy assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The poor only have expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do I start minding my own business? What is the answer?</p>\n<p>Listen to the founder of McDonald’s in the next chapter.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Three</h2>\n<h2>LESSON       3:  MIND      YOUR</h2>\n<h2>OWN      BUSINESS</h2>\n<h2>The rich focus on their asset columns while</h2>\n<h2>everyone else focuses on their income statements.</h2>\n<p>In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s, was asked to</p>\n<p>speak to the MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin. A friend</p>\n<p>of mine was a student in that MBA class. After a powerful and</p>\n<p>inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if he</p>\n<p>would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray</p>\n<p>graciously accepted.</p>\n<p>“What business am I in?” Ray asked, once the group had all their</p>\n<p>beers in hand.</p>\n<p>“Everyone laughed,” my friend said. “Most of the MBA students</p>\n<p>thought Ray was just fooling around.”</p>\n<p>No one answered, so Ray asked again, “What business do you</p>\n<p>think I’m in?”</p>\n<p>The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled</p>\n<p>out, “Ray, who in the world doesn’t know that you’re in the</p>\n<p>hamburger business?”</p>\n<p>Ray chuckled. “That’s what I thought you would say.” He paused and</p>\n<p>then quickly added, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m not in the hamburger</p>\n<p>business. My business is real estate.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Three: Lesson 3</p>\n<p>As my friend tells the story, Ray spent a good amount of time</p>\n<p>explaining his viewpoint. In his business plan, Ray knew that the</p>\n<p>primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what</p>\n<p>he never lost sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew</p>\n<p>that the land and its location were the most significant factors in</p>\n<p>the success of each franchise. Basically, the person who bought the</p>\n<p>franchise was also buying the real estate under the franchise for Ray</p>\n<p>Kroc’s organization.</p>\n<p>Today, McDonald’s is the largest single owner of real estate in</p>\n<p>the world, owning even more than the Catholic church. McDonald’s</p>\n<p>owns some of the most valuable intersections and street corners in</p>\n<p>America and around the globe.</p>\n<p>My friend considers this as one of the most important lessons in</p>\n<p>his life. Today he owns car washes, but his business is the real estate</p>\n<p>under those car washes.</p>\n<p>The previous chapter presented diagrams illustrating that most people</p>\n<p>work for everyone but themselves. They work first for the owners of the</p>\n<p>company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank</p>\n<p>that owns their mortgage.</p>\n<p>When I was a young boy, we did not have a McDonald’s nearby.</p>\n<p>Yet my rich dad was responsible for teaching Mike and me the</p>\n<p>same lesson that Ray Kroc talked about at the University of Texas.</p>\n<p>It is secret number three of the rich. That secret is: Mind your own</p>\n<p>business. Financial struggle is often directly the result of people</p>\n<p>working all their lives for someone else. Many people will simply have</p>\n<p>nothing at the end of their working days to show for their efforts.</p>\n<p>Our current educational system focuses on preparing today’s</p>\n<p>youth to get good jobs by developing scholastic skills. Their lives</p>\n<p>will revolve around their wages or, as described earlier, their income</p>\n<p>column. Many will study further to become engineers, scientists,</p>\n<p>cooks, police officers, artists, writers, and so on. These professional</p>\n<p>skills allow them to enter the workforce and work for money.</p>\n<p>But there is a big difference between your profession and your</p>\n<p>business. Often I ask people, “What is your business?” And they will</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>say, “Oh, I’m a banker.” Then I ask them if they own the bank. And</p>\n<p>they usually respond, “No, I work there.” In that instance, they have</p>\n<p>confused their profession with their business. Their profession may</p>\n<p>be a banker, but they still need their own business.</p>\n<p>A problem with school is that you often become what you study.</p>\n<p>So if you study cooking, you become a chef. If you study the law,</p>\n<p>you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you</p>\n<p>a mechanic. The mistake in becoming what you study is that too</p>\n<p>many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their</p>\n<p>lives minding someone else’s business and making that person rich.</p>\n<p>To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own</p>\n<p>business. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your</p>\n<p>income column. As stated earlier, the number-one rule is to know</p>\n<p>the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets.</p>\n<p>The rich focus on their asset columns, while everyone else focuses on</p>\n<p>their income statements.</p>\n<p>That is why we hear so often: “I need a raise.” “If only I had a</p>\n<p>promotion.” “I am going back to school to get more training so I</p>\n<p>can get a better job.” “I am going to</p>\n<p>Financial struggle is work overtime.” “Maybe I can get a</p>\n<h2>often the result of second job.”</h2>\n<p>people working all their In some circles, these are sensible</p>\n<p>lives for someone else. ideas. But you are still not minding</p>\n<p>your own business. These ideas all still</p>\n<p>focus on the income column and will only help a person become more</p>\n<p>financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-</p>\n<p>generating assets.</p>\n<p>The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are</p>\n<p>fiscally conservative—which means, “I can’t afford to take risks”— is</p>\n<p>that they have no financial foundation. They have to cling to their</p>\n<p>jobs and play it safe.</p>\n<p>When downsizing became the “in” thing to do, millions of</p>\n<p>workers found out their largest so-called asset, their home, was eating</p>\n<p>them alive. Their “asset” was costing them money every month. Their</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Three: Lesson 3</p>\n<p>car, another “asset,” was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the garage</p>\n<p>that cost $1,000 were not worth $1,000 anymore. Without job</p>\n<p>security, they had nothing to fall back on. What they thought were</p>\n<p>assets could not help them survive in a time of financial crisis.</p>\n<p>I assume most of us have filled out a credit application to buy</p>\n<p>a house or a car. It’s always interesting to look at the “net-worth”</p>\n<p>section because of what accepted banking and accounting practices</p>\n<p>allow a person to count as assets.</p>\n<p>One day when I wanted a loan, my financial position did not</p>\n<p>look too good. So I added my new golf clubs, my art collection,</p>\n<p>books, electronics, Armani suits, wristwatches, shoes, and other</p>\n<p>personal effects to boost the number in the asset column.</p>\n<p>But I was turned down because I had too much investment real</p>\n<p>estate. The loan committee didn’t like that I made so much money</p>\n<p>from rent. They wanted to know why I did not have a normal job</p>\n<p>with a salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf clubs,</p>\n<p>or art collection. Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the</p>\n<p>standard profile.</p>\n<p>I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth</p>\n<p>is a million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main</p>\n<p>reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because, the moment you</p>\n<p>begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.</p>\n<p>So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble</p>\n<p>when they run short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets.</p>\n<p>But their personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of</p>\n<p>the value that is listed on their personal balance sheet. Or if there is</p>\n<p>a gain on the sale of the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again,</p>\n<p>the government takes its share, thus reducing the amount available to</p>\n<p>help them out of debt. That is why I say someone’s net worth is often</p>\n<p>“worth less” than they think.</p>\n<p>Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but</p>\n<p>start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no</p>\n<p>real value once you get them home. A new car loses nearly 25 percent</p>\n<p>of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>not a true asset even if your banker lets you list it as one. My $400</p>\n<p>new titanium driver was worth $150 the moment I teed off.</p>\n<p>Keep expenses low, reduce liabilities, and diligently build a base of</p>\n<p>solid assets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is important</p>\n<p>for parents to teach them the difference between an asset and a liability.</p>\n<p>Get them to start building a solid asset column before they leave home,</p>\n<p>get married, buy a house, have kids, and get stuck in a risky financial</p>\n<p>position, clinging to a job, and buying everything on credit. I see so many</p>\n<p>young couples who get married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that</p>\n<p>will not let them get out of debt for most of their working years.</p>\n<p>For many people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents</p>\n<p>realize they have not adequately prepared for retirement and they</p>\n<p>begin to scramble to put some money away. Then their own parents</p>\n<p>become ill and they find themselves with new responsibilities.</p>\n<p>So what kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children</p>\n<p>acquire? In my world, real assets fall into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Businesses that do not require my presence I own them, but</li>\n</ul>\n<p>they are managed or run by other people. If I have to work</p>\n<p>there, it’s not a business. It becomes my job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Stocks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bonds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Income-generating real estate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Notes (IOUs)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts,</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and patents</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and has a ready market</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Three: Lesson 3</p>\n<p>As a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job.</p>\n<p>But my rich dad encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved.</p>\n<p>“If you don’t love it, you won’t take care of it.” I collect real estate simply</p>\n<p>because I love buildings and land. I love shopping for them, and I could</p>\n<p>look at them all day long. When problems arise, the problems aren’t so</p>\n<p>bad that it changes my love for real estate. For people who hate real estate,</p>\n<p>they shouldn’t buy it.</p>\n<p>I also love stocks of small companies, especially start-ups, because</p>\n<p>I am an entrepreneur, not a corporate person. In my early years,</p>\n<p>I worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil of California,</p>\n<p>the U.S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with</p>\n<p>those organizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down</p>\n<p>I am not a company man. I like starting companies, not running</p>\n<p>them. So my stock buys are usually of small companies. Sometimes</p>\n<p>I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in</p>\n<p>new stock issues, and I love the game. Many people are afraid of</p>\n<p>small-cap companies and call them risky, and they are. But that risk</p>\n<p>is diminished if you love what the</p>\n<h2>Start minding your own</h2>\n<p>investment is, understand it, and know</p>\n<h2>business. Keep your</h2>\n<p>the game. With small companies, my</p>\n<p>daytime job, but start investment strategy is to be out of the</p>\n<p>buying real assets, stock in a year. On the other hand, my</p>\n<p>not liabilities. real estate strategy is to start small and</p>\n<p>keep trading up for bigger properties</p>\n<p>and, therefore, delay paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value to</p>\n<p>increase dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years.</p>\n<p>For years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox,</p>\n<p>I did what my rich dad recommended. I kept my day job, but I still</p>\n<p>minded my own business. I was active in my asset column trading real</p>\n<p>estate and small stocks. Rich dad always stressed the importance of</p>\n<p>financial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and</p>\n<p>cash management, the better I would be at analyzing investments and</p>\n<p>eventually starting and building my own company.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>I don’t encourage anyone to start a company unless they really</p>\n<p>want to. Knowing what I know about running a company, I wouldn’t</p>\n<p>wish that task on anyone. There are times when people can’t find</p>\n<p>employment and starting a company seems like the best solution. But</p>\n<p>the odds are against success: Nine out of ten companies fail in five</p>\n<p>years. Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every ten</p>\n<p>of those eventually fail as well. So only if you really have the desire to</p>\n<p>own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your</p>\n<p>day job and mind your own business.</p>\n<p>When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep</p>\n<p>your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come</p>\n<p>out. Think of it this way: Once a dollar goes into your asset column, it</p>\n<p>becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hours a day and can work for generations. Keep your day job, be a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>great hardworking employee, but keep building that asset column.</p>\n<p>As your cash flow grows, you can indulge in some luxuries. An</p>\n<p>important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the</p>\n<p>poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the</p>\n<p>middle class often buy luxury items like big houses, diamonds, furs,</p>\n<p>jewelry, or boats because they want to look rich. They look rich, but</p>\n<p>in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The old-money</p>\n<p>people, the long-term rich, build their asset column first. Then the</p>\n<p>income generated from the asset column buys their luxuries. The poor</p>\n<p>and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood, and</p>\n<p>children’s inheritance.</p>\n<p>A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a</p>\n<p>real asset. For example, when my wife Kim and I had extra money</p>\n<p>coming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her</p>\n<p>Mercedes. It didn’t take any extra work or risk on her part because</p>\n<p>the apartment house bought the car. She did, however, have to wait</p>\n<p>four years while the real estate investment portfolio grew and began</p>\n<p>generating enough extra cash flow to pay for the car. But the luxury,</p>\n<p>the Mercedes, was a true reward because she proved she knew how to</p>\n<p>grow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Three: Lesson 3</p>\n<p>simply another pretty car. It means she used her financial intelligence</p>\n<p>to afford it.</p>\n<p>Instead, most people impulsively go out and buy a new car, or</p>\n<p>some other luxury, on credit. They may feel bored and just want a</p>\n<p>new toy. Buying a luxury on credit often causes a person to eventually</p>\n<p>resent that luxury because the debt becomes a financial burden.</p>\n<p>After you’ve taken the time and invested in and built your own</p>\n<p>business, you are now ready to learn the biggest secret of the rich—</p>\n<p>the secret that puts the rich way ahead of the pack.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Four</h2>\n<h2>LESSON        4: THE    HISTORY         OF</h2>\n<h2>TAXES     AND      THE    POWER</h2>\n<h2>OF    CORPORATIONS</h2>\n<h2>My rich dad just played the game smart,</h2>\n<h2>and he did it through corporations—</h2>\n<h2>the biggest secret of the rich.</h2>\n<p>I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and</p>\n<p>his Merry Men. My teacher thought it was a wonderful story of a</p>\n<p>romantic hero who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich</p>\n<p>dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.</p>\n<p>Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. I often</p>\n<p>still hear people say, “Why don’t the rich pay for it?” or “The rich</p>\n<p>should pay more in taxes and give it to the poor.”</p>\n<p>It is this Robin Hood fantasy, or taking from the rich to give to</p>\n<p>the poor, that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle</p>\n<p>class. The reason the middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the</p>\n<p>Robin Hood ideal. The reality is that the rich are not taxed. It’s the</p>\n<p>middle class, especially the educated upper-income middle class, who</p>\n<p>pays for the poor.</p>\n<p>Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look</p>\n<p>at the history of taxes. Although my highly educated dad was an</p>\n<p>expert on the history of education, my rich dad fashioned himself as</p>\n<p>an expert on the history of taxes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>Rich dad explained to Mike and me that originally, in England</p>\n<p>and America, there were no taxes. Occasionally, there were temporary</p>\n<p>taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would</p>\n<p>put the word out and ask everyone to “chip in.” Taxes were levied in</p>\n<p>Britain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in</p>\n<p>America to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.</p>\n<p>In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens.</p>\n<p>In 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with</p>\n<p>the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. At one</p>\n<p>time, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the tax on tea that led to the</p>\n<p>famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the</p>\n<p>Revolutionary War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and</p>\n<p>the United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.</p>\n<p>What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes</p>\n<p>were initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad</p>\n<p>wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes</p>\n<p>was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and</p>\n<p>the middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is</p>\n<p>how the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal.</p>\n<p>Although it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up</p>\n<p>punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.</p>\n<p>“Once government got a taste of money, its appetite grew,” said rich</p>\n<p>dad. “Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He’s a government bureaucrat,</p>\n<p>and I am a capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on</p>\n<p>opposite behaviors. He gets paid to spend money and hire people. The</p>\n<p>more he spends and the more people he hires, the larger his organization</p>\n<p>becomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected</p>\n<p>organization. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer</p>\n<p>people I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my</p>\n<p>investors. That’s why I don’t like government people. They have different</p>\n<p>objectives than most business people. As the government grows, more</p>\n<p>and more tax dollars are needed to support it.”</p>\n<p>My educated dad sincerely believed that government should help</p>\n<p>people. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Corps. He loved the idea so much that both he and my mom worked</p>\n<p>for the Peace Corps, training volunteers to go to Malaysia, Thailand,</p>\n<p>and the Philippines. He always strived for additional grants and budget</p>\n<p>increases so he could hire more people, both in his job with the</p>\n<p>Education Department and in the Peace Corps.</p>\n<p>From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich</p>\n<p>dad that government workers were a pack of lazy thieves, and from</p>\n<p>my poor dad I would hear how the</p>\n<h2>My rich dad did not see</h2>\n<p>rich were greedy crooks who should be</p>\n<h2>Robin Hood as a hero.</h2>\n<p>made to pay more taxes. Both sides had</p>\n<p>He called Robin Hood valid points. It was difficult to go to</p>\n<p>a crook.     work for one of the biggest capitalists in</p>\n<p>town and come home to a father who</p>\n<p>was a prominent government leader. It was not easy to know which dad</p>\n<p>to believe.</p>\n<p>Yet when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective</p>\n<p>emerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the</p>\n<p>masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics: Take from the</p>\n<p>rich, and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government’s</p>\n<p>appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on</p>\n<p>the middle class, and from there it kept trickling down.</p>\n<p>However, the rich saw an opportunity because they don’t play by</p>\n<p>the same set of rules. The rich knew about corporations, which became</p>\n<p>popular in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the corporation</p>\n<p>as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The rich put</p>\n<p>their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation</p>\n<p>would then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasure. If</p>\n<p>the ship was lost, the crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would</p>\n<p>be limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>The diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits</p>\n<p>outside your personal income statement and balance sheet.</p>\n<p>CORPORATION</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>PERSONAL</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Expenses               Income</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>PERSONAL  BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>It is the knowledge of the legal corporate structure that really gives</p>\n<p>the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two</p>\n<p>fathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly</p>\n<p>began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial</p>\n<p>sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized</p>\n<p>themselves due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the</p>\n<p>“take-from-the-rich” crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to</p>\n<p>outsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle</p>\n<p>class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals solely because they understood</p>\n<p>the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.</p>\n<p>How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the “take-from-</p>\n<p>the-rich” tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers.</p>\n<p>Initially, people were happy. Money was handed out to government</p>\n<p>workers and the rich. It went to government workers in the form of</p>\n<p>jobs and pensions, and it went to the rich via their factories receiving</p>\n<p>government contracts. The government received a large pool of money,</p>\n<p>but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. The</p>\n<p>government ideal is to avoid having excess money. If you fail to spend</p>\n<p>your allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would</p>\n<p>certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the</p>\n<p>other hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are applauded for</p>\n<p>their efficiency. As this cycle of growing government spending continued,</p>\n<p>the demand for money increased, and the “tax-the-rich” idea was adjusted</p>\n<p>to include lower-income levels, down to the very people who voted it in,</p>\n<p>the poor and the middle class.</p>\n<p>True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find an</p>\n<p>escape. They headed back to the protection of a corporation. But</p>\n<p>what many people who have never formed a corporation don’t know</p>\n<p>is that a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a</p>\n<p>file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney’s</p>\n<p>office and registered with a state government agency. It’s not a big</p>\n<p>building or a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a</p>\n<p>legal document that creates a legal body without a soul. Using it, the</p>\n<p>wealth of the rich was once again protected. It was popular because</p>\n<p>the income-tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>income-tax rates. In addition, certain expenses could be paid by a</p>\n<p>corporation with pre-tax dollars.</p>\n<p>This war between the haves and have-nots has raged for hundreds</p>\n<p>of years. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws are made, and</p>\n<p>it will go on forever. The problem is that the people who lose are the</p>\n<p>uninformed: the ones who get up every day and diligently go to work</p>\n<p>and pay taxes. If they only understood the way the rich play</p>\n<p>the game, they could play it too. Then they would be on their way</p>\n<p>to their own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time</p>\n<p>I hear a parent advise their children to go to school so they can find</p>\n<p>a safe, secure job. An employee with a safe, secure job, without financial</p>\n<p>aptitude, has no escape.</p>\n<p>Average Americans today work four to five months for the</p>\n<p>government just to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is simply too</p>\n<p>long. The harder you work, the more you pay the government. That is</p>\n<p>why I believe that the idea of “take-from-the-rich” backfired on the very</p>\n<p>people who voted it in.</p>\n<p>Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don’t simply</p>\n<p>comply. They react. They have the money, power, and intent to change</p>\n<p>things. They don’t just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. Instead,</p>\n<p>they search for ways to minimize their tax burden. They hire smart</p>\n<p>attorneys and accountants, and persuade politicians to change laws or</p>\n<p>create legal loopholes. They use their resources to effect change.</p>\n<p>The Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to reduce</p>\n<p>taxes. Most of these vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich</p>\n<p>who find them because they are minding their own business. For</p>\n<p>example, “1031” is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue</p>\n<p>Code which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate</p>\n<p>that is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive</p>\n<p>piece of real estate. Real estate is one investment vehicle that has a great</p>\n<p>tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in value, you will not be</p>\n<p>taxed on the gains until you liquidate. People who don’t take advantage</p>\n<p>of these legal tax savings are missing a great opportunity to build their</p>\n<p>asset columns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>The poor and middle class don’t have the same resources. They sit</p>\n<p>there and let the government’s needles enter their arm and allow the</p>\n<p>blood donation to begin. Today, I am constantly shocked at the number</p>\n<p>of people who pay more taxes, or take fewer deductions, simply because</p>\n<p>they are afraid of the government. I have friends who have had their</p>\n<p>businesses shut down and destroyed, only to find out it was a mistake</p>\n<p>on the part of the government. I realize all that. But the price of working</p>\n<p>from January to May is a high price to pay for that intimidation. My</p>\n<p>poor dad never fought back. My rich dad didn’t either. He just played the</p>\n<p>game smarter, and he did it through corporations—the biggest secret of</p>\n<p>the rich.</p>\n<p>You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad.</p>\n<p>I was a little boy of 9 who had to sit and wait for him to choose to talk</p>\n<p>to me. I sat in his office waiting for him to get to me. He was ignoring</p>\n<p>me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and to desire to</p>\n<p>have that power for myself one day. During all the years I studied and</p>\n<p>learned from him, he always reminded me that knowledge is power.</p>\n<p>And with money comes great power</p>\n<p>If you work for money, that requires the right knowledge to</p>\n<p>you give the power to keep it and make it multiply. Without</p>\n<p>you employer.  that knowledge, the world pushes you</p>\n<p>If money works for you, around. Rich dad constantly reminded</p>\n<p>you keep the power and Mike and me that the biggest bully was</p>\n<p>not the boss or the supervisor, but the</p>\n<h2>control it.</h2>\n<p>tax man. The tax man will always take</p>\n<p>more if you let him. The first lesson of having money work for you, as</p>\n<p>opposed to you working for money, is all about power. If you work for</p>\n<p>money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you,</p>\n<p>you keep the power and control it.</p>\n<p>Once we had this knowledge of the power of money working</p>\n<p>for us, he wanted us to be financially smart and not let anyone or</p>\n<p>anything push us around. If you’re ignorant, it’s easy to be bullied.</p>\n<p>If you know what you’re talking about, you have a fighting chance.</p>\n<p>That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and attorneys.</p>\n<p>It was less expensive to pay them than to pay the government. His</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>best lesson to me was: “Be smart and you won’t be pushed around as</p>\n<p>much.” He knew the law because he was a law-abiding citizen and</p>\n<p>because it was expensive to not know the law. “If you know you’re</p>\n<p>right, you’re not afraid of fighting back.” Even if you are taking on</p>\n<p>Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.</p>\n<p>My highly educated dad always encouraged me to land a good job</p>\n<p>with a strong corporation. He spoke of the virtues of “working your</p>\n<p>way up the corporate ladder.” He didn’t understand that, by relying</p>\n<p>solely on a paycheck from a corporate employer, I would be a docile</p>\n<p>cow ready for milking.</p>\n<p>When I told my rich dad of my father’s advice, he only chuckled.</p>\n<p>“Why not own the ladder?” was all he said.</p>\n<p>As a young boy, I did not understand what rich dad meant by</p>\n<p>owning my own corporation. It was an idea that seemed impossible</p>\n<p>and intimidating. Although I was excited by the idea, my inexperience</p>\n<p>wouldn’t let me envision the possibility that grown-ups would someday</p>\n<p>work for a company I would own.</p>\n<p>The point is that, if not for my rich</p>\n<h2>Each dollar</h2>\n<p>dad, I would have probably followed</p>\n<h2>in my asset column</h2>\n<p>my educated dad’s advice. It was merely</p>\n<h2>was a great employee,</h2>\n<p>the occasional reminder of my rich</p>\n<p>working hard to make dad that kept the idea of owning my</p>\n<h2>more employees  own corporation alive and kept me</h2>\n<p>and buy the boss on a different path. By the time I was</p>\n<h2>a new Porsche. 15 or 16, I knew I wasn’t going to</h2>\n<p>continue down the path my educated</p>\n<p>dad recommended. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but I was</p>\n<p>determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates were</p>\n<h2>heading. That decision changed my life.</h2>\n<p>It was not until my mid-twenties that my rich dad’s advice began</p>\n<p>to make more sense to me. I was just out of the Marine Corps and</p>\n<p>working for Xerox. I was making a lot of money, but every time I</p>\n<p>looked at my paycheck, I was disappointed. The deductions were so</p>\n<p>large and, the more I worked, the greater they became. As I became</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>more successful, my bosses talked about promotions and raises. It was</p>\n<p>flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking in my ear: “Who are</p>\n<p>you working for? Who are you making rich?”</p>\n<p>In 1974, while still an employee for Xerox, I formed my first</p>\n<p>corporation and began minding my own business. There were already</p>\n<p>a few assets in my asset column, but now I was determined to focus</p>\n<p>on making it bigger. Those paychecks, with all the deductions, made</p>\n<p>all the years of my rich dad’s advice make total sense. I could see the</p>\n<p>future if I followed my educated dad’s advice.</p>\n<p>Many employers feel that advising their workers to mind their</p>\n<p>own business is bad for business. But for me, focusing on my own</p>\n<p>business and developing assets made me a better employee because</p>\n<p>I now had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, amassing</p>\n<p>as much money as possible so I could invest in real estate. Hawaii</p>\n<p>was just set to boom, and there were fortunes to be made. The more</p>\n<p>I realized that we were in the beginning stages of a boom, the more</p>\n<p>Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the more money I made</p>\n<p>and, of course, the more deductions came out of my paycheck. It was</p>\n<p>inspiring. I wanted out of the employee trap so badly that I worked</p>\n<p>even harder so I could invest more. By 1978, I was consistently one</p>\n<p>of the top five sales people at the company. I badly wanted out of the</p>\n<p>Rat Race.</p>\n<p>In less than three years, I was making more in my real estate</p>\n<p>holding corporation than I was making at Xerox. And the money</p>\n<p>I was making in my asset column in my own corporation was</p>\n<p>money working for me, not me pounding on doors selling copiers.</p>\n<p>My rich dad’s advice made much more sense. Soon the cash flow</p>\n<p>from my properties was so strong that my company bought me my</p>\n<p>first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople thought I was spending</p>\n<p>my commissions. I wasn’t. I was investing my commissions in assets.</p>\n<p>My money was working hard to make more money. Each dollar</p>\n<p>in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make</p>\n<p>more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche with before-tax</p>\n<p>dollars. I began to work harder for Xerox. The plan was working,</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>and my Porsche was the proof. By using the lessons I learned from my</p>\n<p>rich dad, I was able to get out of the proverbial Rat Race at an early</p>\n<p>age. It was made possible because of the strong financial knowledge I</p>\n<p>had acquired through rich dad’s lessons.</p>\n<p>Without this financial knowledge, which I call financial intelligence</p>\n<p>or financial IQ, my road to financial independence would have been</p>\n<p>much more difficult. I now teach others in the hope that I may share</p>\n<p>my knowledge with them.</p>\n<p>I remind people that financial IQ is made up of knowledge from</p>\n<p>four broad areas of expertise:</p>\n<h2>1. Accounting</h2>\n<p>Accounting is financial literacy or the ability to read numbers.</p>\n<p>This is a vital skill if you want to build an empire. The more</p>\n<p>money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required,</p>\n<p>or the house comes tumbling down. This is the left-brain</p>\n<p>side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read and</p>\n<p>understand financial statements which allows you to identify</p>\n<p>the strengths and weaknesses of any business.</p>\n<h2>2. Investing</h2>\n<p>Investing is the science of “money making money.” This</p>\n<p>involves strategies and formulas which use the creative</p>\n<p>right-brain side.</p>\n<h2>3. Understanding markets</h2>\n<p>Understanding markets is the science of supply and demand.</p>\n<p>You need to know the technical aspects of the market, which are</p>\n<p>emotion-driven, in addition to the fundamental or economic</p>\n<p>aspects of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does</p>\n<p>it not make sense based on current market conditions?</p>\n<h2>4. The law</h2>\n<p>A corporation wrapped around the technical skills of</p>\n<p>accounting, investing, and markets can contribute to explosive</p>\n<p>growth. A person who understands the tax advantages and</p>\n<p>protections provided by a corporation can get rich so much</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>faster than someone who is an employee or a small-business</p>\n<p>sole proprietor. It’s like the difference between someone walking</p>\n<p>and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes</p>\n<p>to long-term wealth.</p>\n<h2>•  Tax advantages</h2>\n<p>A corporation can do many things that an employee cannot,</p>\n<p>like pay expenses before paying taxes. That is a whole area of</p>\n<p>expertise that is very exciting. Employees earn and get taxed,</p>\n<p>and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns,</p>\n<p>spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is</p>\n<p>left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich</p>\n<p>use. They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own</p>\n<p>investments that are producing good cashflow. For example,</p>\n<p>by owning your own corporation, your vacations can be</p>\n<p>board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs,</p>\n<p>and health-club memberships are company expenses. Most</p>\n<p>restaurant meals are partial expenses, and on and on. But it’s</p>\n<p>done legally with pre-tax dollars.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protection from lawsuits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of</p>\n<p>your action. The rich hide much of their wealth using</p>\n<p>vehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their</p>\n<p>assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy</p>\n<p>individual, they are often met with layers of legal protection</p>\n<p>and often find that the wealthy person actually owns</p>\n<p>nothing. They control everything, but own nothing. The</p>\n<p>poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to</p>\n<p>the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the</p>\n<p>rich. They learned it from the Robin Hood story: Take</p>\n<p>from the rich, and give it to the poor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Four: Lesson 4</p>\n<p>It is not the purpose of this book to go into the specifics of owning</p>\n<p>a corporation. But I will say that if you own any kind of legitimate assets,</p>\n<p>I would consider finding out more about the benefits and protection</p>\n<p>offered by a corporation as soon as possible. There are many books</p>\n<p>written on the subject that will detail the benefits and even walk you</p>\n<p>through the steps necessary to set up a corporation. Garret Sutton’s</p>\n<p>books on corporations provide wonderful insight into the power of</p>\n<p>personal corporations.</p>\n<p>Financial IQ is actually the synergy of many skills and talents.</p>\n<p>I would say it is the combination of the four technical skills listed</p>\n<p>above that make up basic financial intelligence. If you aspire to great</p>\n<p>wealth, it is the combination of these skills that will greatly amplify</p>\n<p>your financial intelligence.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>Business Owners  Employees Who Work</p>\n<p>with Corporations for Corporations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Earn          1. Earn</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spend         2. Pay Taxes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pay Taxes     3. Spend</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As part of your overall financial strategy, I recommend that</p>\n<p>you learn about the protection that legal entities can provide for</p>\n<p>businesses and assets.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Five</h2>\n<h2>LESSON        5: THE     RICH</h2>\n<h2>INVENT       MONEY</h2>\n<h2>Often in the real world, it’s not the smart</h2>\n<h2>who get ahead, but the bold.</h2>\n<p>Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV</p>\n<p>program on the history of a young man named Alexander Graham</p>\n<p>Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone and was having growing</p>\n<p>pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong.</p>\n<p>Needing a bigger company, he then went to the giant at that time,</p>\n<p>Western Union, and asked them if they would buy his patent and</p>\n<p>his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The</p>\n<p>president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down,</p>\n<p>saying the price was ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-</p>\n<p>dollar industry emerged, and AT&amp;T was born.</p>\n<p>The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander</p>\n<p>Graham Bell. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a</p>\n<p>local company. The workers were angry and complained that the</p>\n<p>company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about</p>\n<ul>\n<li>years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was</li>\n</ul>\n<p>begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would</p>\n<p>reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was</p>\n<p>afraid of losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the</p>\n<p>world to see. Needless to say, it held my attention.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great</p>\n<p>experience and a rewarding one. It is also a disturbing profession, for</p>\n<p>I have taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common</p>\n<p>in all of us, myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and</p>\n<p>we all are blessed with gifts. Yet the one thing that holds all of us back</p>\n<p>is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical</p>\n<p>information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence.</p>\n<p>Some are more affected than others.</p>\n<p>Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not so much a</p>\n<p>matter of college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world</p>\n<p>outside of academics, something more than just grades is required.</p>\n<p>I have heard it called many things; guts, chutzpah, balls, audacity,</p>\n<p>bravado, cunning, daring, tenacity, and brilliance. This factor,</p>\n<p>whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one’s future much more</p>\n<p>than school grades do.</p>\n<p>Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant, and daring</p>\n<p>characters. There is also the flip side of that character: people who</p>\n<p>could get down on their knees and beg if necessary. After a year in</p>\n<p>Vietnam as a Marine Corps pilot, I got to know both of those</p>\n<p>characters inside of me intimately. One is not better than the other.</p>\n<p>Yet as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and</p>\n<p>self-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius. It</p>\n<p>broke my heart to see students know the answers, yet lack the courage</p>\n<p>to act on the answer. Often in the real world, it’s not the smart who</p>\n<p>get ahead, but the bold.</p>\n<p>In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both</p>\n<p>technical knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the</p>\n<p>genius is suppressed. In my classes, I strongly urge students to learn</p>\n<p>to take risks, to be bold, and to let their genius convert that fear into</p>\n<p>power and brilliance. It works for some and just terrifies others. I have</p>\n<p>come to realize that for most people, when it comes to the subject of</p>\n<p>money, they would rather play it safe. I have had to field questions</p>\n<p>such as: “Why take risks?” “Why should I bother developing my</p>\n<p>financial IQ?” “Why should I become financially literate?” And I</p>\n<p>answer, “Just to have more options.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>There are huge changes up ahead. In the coming years, there will</p>\n<p>be more people just like the young inventor Alexander Graham Bell.</p>\n<p>There will be a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely successful</p>\n<p>companies like Microsoft created every year, all over the world. And</p>\n<p>there also will be many more bankruptcies, layoffs, and downsizings.</p>\n<p>So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer</p>\n<p>that but you. Yet I can tell you why I myself do it. I do it because it</p>\n<p>is the most exciting time to be alive. I’d rather be welcoming change</p>\n<p>than dreading change. I’d rather be excited about making millions than</p>\n<p>worrying about not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most</p>\n<p>exciting time, unprecedented in our world’s history. Generations from</p>\n<p>now, people will look back at this period of time and remark at what an</p>\n<p>exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old and birth of</p>\n<p>the new. It was full of turmoil, and it was exciting.</p>\n<p>So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do,</p>\n<p>you will prosper greatly. And if you don’t, this period of time will be</p>\n<p>a frightening one. It will be a time of watching some people move</p>\n<p>boldly forward while others cling to worn-out life preservers.</p>\n<p>Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the</p>\n<p>land owned the wealth. Later, wealth was in factories and production,</p>\n<p>and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the wealth.</p>\n<p>Today, wealth is in information. And the person who has the most</p>\n<p>timely information owns the wealth. The problem is that information</p>\n<p>flies around the world at the speed of light. The new wealth cannot be</p>\n<p>contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The</p>\n<p>changes will be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic</p>\n<p>increase in the number of new multimillionaires. There also will be</p>\n<p>those who are left behind.</p>\n<p>I find so many people struggling today, often working harder,</p>\n<p>simply because they cling to old ideas. They want things to be the way</p>\n<p>they were, and they resist change. I know people who are losing their</p>\n<p>jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or</p>\n<p>their boss. Sadly, they fail to realize that they might be the problem.</p>\n<p>Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a liability simply because they</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an</p>\n<p>asset yesterday, yesterday is gone.</p>\n<p>One afternoon I was teaching how to invest using a board game</p>\n<p>I had invented, CASHFLOW®, as a teaching tool. A friend had brought</p>\n<p>someone along to attend the class. This friend of a friend was recently</p>\n<p>divorced, had been badly burned in the divorce settlement, and was now</p>\n<p>searching for some answers. Her friend thought the class might help.</p>\n<p>The game was designed to help people learn how money works.</p>\n<p>In playing the game, they learn about the interaction of the income</p>\n<p>statement with the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>You can play CASHFLOW They learn how cash flows between</p>\n<p>Classic on the web at the two and how the road to wealth</p>\n<p>www.richdad.com and is through striving to increase your</p>\n<p>learn how money works. monthly cash flow from the asset</p>\n<p>column to the point that it exceeds</p>\n<p>your monthly expenses. Once you accomplish this, you are able to get</p>\n<p>out of the Rat Race and out onto the Fast Track.</p>\n<p>As I have said, some people hate the game, some love it, and</p>\n<p>others miss the point. This woman missed a valuable opportunity to</p>\n<p>learn something. In the opening round, she drew a “doodad” card</p>\n<p>with the boat on it. At first she was happy. “Oh, I’ve got a boat.”</p>\n<p>Then, as her friend tried to explain how the numbers worked on her</p>\n<p>income statement and balance sheet, she got frustrated because she</p>\n<p>had never liked math. The rest of her table waited while her friend</p>\n<p>continued explaining the relationship between the income statement,</p>\n<p>balance sheet, and monthly cash flow. Suddenly, when she realized</p>\n<p>how the numbers worked, it dawned on her that her boat was eating</p>\n<p>her alive. Later on in the game, she was also downsized and had a</p>\n<h2>child. It was a horrible game for her.</h2>\n<p>After the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset.</p>\n<p>She had come to the class to learn about investing and did not like</p>\n<p>the idea that it took so long to play a silly game.</p>\n<p>Her friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if</p>\n<p>the game reflected her in any way. With that suggestion, the woman</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>demanded her money back. She said that the very idea that a game</p>\n<p>could be a reflection of her was ridiculous. Her money was promptly</p>\n<p>refunded, and she left.</p>\n<p>Since 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the</p>\n<p>school system does not do. In school, most teachers lecture. I hated</p>\n<p>lectures as a student. I was soon bored, and my mind would drift.</p>\n<p>In 1984, I began teaching via games and simulations, and I still rely</p>\n<p>on these tools today. I always encourage adult students to look at games</p>\n<p>as reflecting back to them what they know and what they need to learn.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, games reflect behavior. They are instant feedback</p>\n<p>systems. Instead of the teacher lecturing you, the game is giving you a</p>\n<p>personalized lecture, one that is custom-made just for you.</p>\n<p>The friend of the woman who left later called to give me an</p>\n<p>update. She said her friend was fine and had calmed down. In her</p>\n<p>cooling-off period, she could see some slight relationship between</p>\n<p>the game and her life. Although she and her husband did not own a</p>\n<p>boat, they did own everything else</p>\n<p>imaginable. She was angry after their</p>\n<h2>Games reflect behavior.</h2>\n<p>divorce, both because he had run off</p>\n<h2>They are instant</h2>\n<p>with a younger woman and because,</p>\n<h2>feedback systems.</h2>\n<p>after twenty years of marriage,</p>\n<p>they had accumulated little in the</p>\n<p>way of assets. There was virtually nothing for them to split. Their</p>\n<p>twenty years of married life had been incredible fun, but all they had</p>\n<p>accumulated was a ton of doodads.</p>\n<p>She realized that her anger at doing the numbers—the income</p>\n<p>statement and balance sheet—came from her embarrassment about</p>\n<p>not understanding them. She had believed that finances were the</p>\n<p>man’s job. She maintained the house and did the entertaining, and he</p>\n<p>handled the finances. She was now quite certain, that in the last five</p>\n<p>years of their marriage, he had hidden money from her. She was angry</p>\n<p>at herself for not being more aware of where the money was going, as</p>\n<p>well as for not knowing about the other woman.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>Just like a board game, the world is always providing us with</p>\n<p>instant feedback. We could learn a lot if we tuned in more. One day</p>\n<p>not long ago, I complained to my wife that the cleaners must have</p>\n<p>shrunk my pants. My wife gently smiled and poked me in the stomach</p>\n<p>to inform me that the pants had not shrunk. Something else had</p>\n<p>expanded—me!</p>\n<p>The CASHFLOW game was designed to give every player personal</p>\n<p>feedback. Its purpose is to give you options. If you draw the boat card</p>\n<p>and it puts you into debt, the question is: “Now what can you do?</p>\n<p>How many different financial options can you come up with?” That is</p>\n<p>the purpose of the game: to teach players to think and create new and</p>\n<p>various financial options. Thousands of people throughout the world</p>\n<p>have played this game. The players who get out of the Rat Race the</p>\n<p>quickest are the people who understand numbers and have creative</p>\n<p>financial minds. They recognize different financial options. Rich</p>\n<p>people are often creative and take calculated risks. People who take</p>\n<p>the longest are people who are not familiar with numbers and often</p>\n<p>do not understand the power of investing.</p>\n<p>Some people playing CASHFLOW</p>\n<p>Play CASHFLOW Classic gain lots of money in the game, but</p>\n<h2>on the web at   they don’t know what to do with</h2>\n<p>www.richdad.com   it. Even though they have money,</p>\n<p>everyone else seems to be getting</p>\n<p>What did you learn about ahead of them. And that is true in</p>\n<h2>your true behavior from</h2>\n<p>real life. There are a lot of people who</p>\n<h2>playing the game</h2>\n<p>have a lot of money and do not</p>\n<p>get ahead financially.</p>\n<p>Limiting your options is the same as hanging on to old ideas.</p>\n<p>I have a friend from high school who now works at three jobs. Years</p>\n<p>ago, he was the richest of all my classmates. When the local sugar</p>\n<p>plantation closed, the company he worked for went down with the</p>\n<p>plantation. In his mind, he had but one option, and that was the</p>\n<p>old option: Work hard. The problem was that he couldn’t find an</p>\n<p>equivalent job that recognized his seniority from the old company.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>As a result, he is overqualified for the jobs he currently has, so his</p>\n<p>salary is lower. He now works three jobs to earn enough to survive.</p>\n<p>I have watched people playing CASHFLOW complain that the right</p>\n<p>opportunity cards are not coming their way. So they sit there. I know</p>\n<p>people who do that in real life. They wait for the right opportunity.</p>\n<p>I have watched people get the right opportunity card and then</p>\n<p>not have enough money. Then they complain that they would have</p>\n<p>gotten out of the Rat Race if they had had more money. So they sit</p>\n<p>there. I know people in real life who do that also. They see all the great</p>\n<p>deals, but they have no money.</p>\n<p>And I have seen people pull a great opportunity card, read it out</p>\n<p>loud, and have no idea that it is a great opportunity. They have the</p>\n<p>money, the time is right, they have the card, but they can’t see the</p>\n<p>opportunity staring them in the face. They fail to see how it fits into</p>\n<p>their financial plan for escaping the Rat Race. And I know more</p>\n<p>people like that than all the others combined. Most people have an</p>\n<p>opportunity of a lifetime flash right in front of them, and they fail to</p>\n<p>see it. A year later, they find out about it, after everyone else got rich.</p>\n<p>Financial intelligence is simply having more options. If the</p>\n<p>opportunities aren’t coming your way, what else can you do to</p>\n<p>improve your financial position? If an opportunity lands in your lap</p>\n<p>and you have no money and the bank won’t talk to you, what else can</p>\n<p>you do to get the opportunity to work in your favor? If your hunch</p>\n<p>is wrong, and what you’ve been counting on doesn’t happen, how can</p>\n<p>you turn a lemon into millions? That is financial intelligence. It is not</p>\n<p>so much what happens, but how many different financial solutions</p>\n<p>you can think of to turn a lemon into millions. It is how creative you</p>\n<p>are in solving financial problems.</p>\n<p>Most people only know one solution: Work hard, save, and</p>\n<p>borrow. So why would you want to increase your financial intelligence?</p>\n<p>Because you want to be the kind of person who creates your own luck.</p>\n<p>You take whatever happens and make it better. Few people realize that</p>\n<p>luck is created, just as money is. And if you want to be luckier and</p>\n<p>create money instead of working hard, then your financial intelligence</p>\n<p>is important. If you are the kind of person who is waiting for the right</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>thing to happen, you might wait for a long time. It’s like waiting for all</p>\n<p>the traffic lights to be green for five miles before you’ll start your trip.</p>\n<p>As young boys, Mike and I were constantly told by my rich dad that</p>\n<p>“money is not real.” Rich dad occasionally reminded us of how close we</p>\n<p>came to the secret of money on that first day we got together and began</p>\n<p>“making money” out of plaster of paris. “The poor and middle class work</p>\n<p>for money,” he would say. “The rich make money. The more real you</p>\n<p>think money is, the harder you will work for it. If you can grasp the idea</p>\n<p>that money is not real, you will grow richer faster.”</p>\n<p>“What is it?” was a question Mike and I often came back with.</p>\n<p>“What is money if it is not real?”</p>\n<p>“What we agree it is,” was all rich dad would say.</p>\n<p>The single most powerful asset we all have is our mind. If it is</p>\n<p>trained well, it can create enormous wealth seemingly instantaneously.</p>\n<p>An untrained mind can also create extreme poverty that can crush a</p>\n<p>family for generations.</p>\n<p>In the Information Age, money is increasing exponentially. A few</p>\n<p>individuals are getting ridiculously rich from nothing, just ideas and</p>\n<p>agreements. If you ask many people</p>\n<h2>The single most</h2>\n<p>who trade stocks or other investments</p>\n<h2>powerful asset we all</h2>\n<p>for a living, they see it done all the</p>\n<h2>have is our mind.</h2>\n<p>time. Often, millions can be made</p>\n<p>If it is trained well, instantaneously from nothing. And</p>\n<h2>it can create by nothing, I mean no money was</h2>\n<p>enormous wealth. exchanged. It is done via agreement: a</p>\n<p>hand signal in a trading pit, a blip on a</p>\n<p>trader’s screen in Lisbon from a trader’s screen in Toronto and back to</p>\n<p>Lisbon, a call to my broker to buy and a moment later to sell. Money</p>\n<h2>did not change hands. Agreements did.</h2>\n<p>So why develop your financial genius? Only you can answer that.</p>\n<p>I can tell you why I have been developing this area of my intelligence.</p>\n<p>I do it because I want to make money fast. Not because I need to, but</p>\n<p>because I want to. It is a fascinating learning process. I develop my</p>\n<p>financial IQ because I want to participate in the fastest game and</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>biggest game in the world. And in my own small way, I would like to</p>\n<p>be part of this unprecedented evolution of humanity, the era where</p>\n<p>humans work purely with their minds and not with their bodies.</p>\n<p>Besides, it is where the action is. It is what is happening. It’s hip.</p>\n<p>It’s scary. And it’s fun.</p>\n<p>That is why I invest in my financial intelligence, developing the most</p>\n<p>powerful asset I have. I want to be with people moving boldly forward.</p>\n<p>I do not want to be with those left behind.</p>\n<p>I will give you a simple example of creating money. In the early</p>\n<ul>\n<li>s, the economy of Phoenix, Arizona, was horrible. I was watching a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TV show when a financial planner came on and began forecasting doom</p>\n<p>and gloom. His advice was to save money. “Put $100 away every month,”</p>\n<p>he said. “In 40 years you will be a multimillionaire.”</p>\n<p>Well, putting money away every month is a sound idea. It is one</p>\n<p>option—the option most people subscribe to. The problem is this: It</p>\n<p>blinds the person to what is really going on. It causes them to miss major</p>\n<p>opportunities for much more significant growth of their money. The</p>\n<p>world is passing them by.</p>\n<p>As I said, the economy was terrible at that time. For investors,</p>\n<p>this is the perfect market condition. A chunk of my money was</p>\n<p>in the stock market and in apartment houses. I was short of cash.</p>\n<p>Because people were giving properties away, I was buying. I was not</p>\n<p>saving money. I was investing. Kim and I had more than a million</p>\n<p>dollars in cash working in a market that was rising fast. It was the best</p>\n<p>opportunity to invest. The economy was terrible. I just could not pass</p>\n<p>up these small deals.</p>\n<p>Houses that were once $100,000 were now $75,000. But instead</p>\n<p>of shopping with local real estate agents, I began shopping at the</p>\n<p>bankruptcy attorney’s office, or the courthouse steps. In these</p>\n<p>shopping places, a $75,000 house could sometimes be bought for</p>\n<p>$20,000 or less. For $2,000, which was loaned to me from a friend</p>\n<p>for 90 days for $200, I gave an attorney a cashier’s check as a down</p>\n<p>payment. While the acquisition was being processed, I ran an ad</p>\n<p>advertising a $75,000 house for only $60,000 and no money down.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>The phone rang hard and heavy. Prospective buyers were screened</p>\n<p>and once the property was legally mine, all the prospective buyers</p>\n<p>were allowed to look at the house. It was a feeding frenzy. The house</p>\n<p>sold in a few minutes. I asked for a $2,500 processing fee, which</p>\n<p>they gladly handed over, and the escrow and title company took over</p>\n<p>from there. I returned the $2,000 to my friend with an additional</p>\n<p>$200. He was happy, the home buyer was happy, the attorney was</p>\n<p>happy, and I was happy. I had sold a house for $60,000 that cost me</p>\n<p>$20,000. The $40,000 was created from money in my asset column</p>\n<p>in the form of a promissory note from the buyer. Total working time:</p>\n<p>five hours.</p>\n<p>So now that you are on your way to becoming more financially</p>\n<p>literate and skilled at reading numbers, I will show you why this is</p>\n<p>an example of money being invented.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>$40,000 is created in the</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>asset column. Money is</p>\n<p>invented without being</p>\n<p>taxed. At 10 percent</p>\n<p>interest, $4,000</p>\n<p>a year in cash flow is</p>\n<p>added to income.        Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Mortgage Payment</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets    Liabilities</p>\n<p>$40,000   $20,000</p>\n<p>Note      Mortgage</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>During this depressed market, Kim and I were able to do six of these</p>\n<p>simple transactions in our spare time. While the bulk of our money was</p>\n<p>in larger properties and the stock market, we were able to create more</p>\n<p>than $190,000 in assets (notes at 10 percent interest) in those six “buy,</p>\n<p>create, and sell” transactions. That comes to approximately $19,000</p>\n<p>a year income, much of it sheltered through our private corporation.</p>\n<p>Much of that $19,000 a year goes to pay for our company cars, gas,</p>\n<p>trips, insurance, dinners with clients, and other things. By the time the</p>\n<p>government gets a chance to tax that income, it’s been spent on legally</p>\n<p>allowed pre-tax expenses.</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Job</p>\n<p>How much income</p>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<p>would you have to</p>\n<p>earn if the government</p>\n<p>takes 50 percent          Expenses</p>\n<p>in taxes?                 Taxes</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets   Liabilities</p>\n<p>Savings</p>\n<p>How long would it take</p>\n<p>you to save $40,000?</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>This was a simple example of how money is invented, created, and</p>\n<p>protected using financial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself: How long would it take to save $190,000? Would the</p>\n<p>bank pay you 10 percent interest on your money? And the promissory</p>\n<p>note is good for 30 years. I hope they never pay me the $190,000. I have</p>\n<p>to pay a tax if they pay me the principal, and besides, $19,000 paid over</p>\n<ul>\n<li>years is a little over $500,000 in income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have people ask what happens if the person doesn’t pay. That does</p>\n<p>happen, and it’s good news. That $60,000 home could be taken back and</p>\n<p>re-sold for $70,000, and another $2,500 collected as a loan-processing</p>\n<p>fee. It would still be a zero-down transaction in the mind of the new</p>\n<p>buyer. And the process would go on.</p>\n<p>The first time I sold the house, I paid back the $2,000, so technically,</p>\n<p>I have no money in the transaction. My return on investment (ROI) is</p>\n<p>infinity. It’s an example of no money making a lot of money.</p>\n<p>In the second transaction, when re-sold, I would have put $2,000 in</p>\n<p>my pocket and re-extended the loan to 30 years. What would my ROI</p>\n<p>be if I got paid money to make money? I do not know, but it sure beats</p>\n<p>saving $100 a month, which actually starts out as $150 because it’s after-</p>\n<p>tax income for 40 years earning low interest. And again, you’re taxed on</p>\n<p>the interest. That is not too intelligent. It may be safe, but it’s not smart.</p>\n<p>A few years later, as the Phoenix real estate market strengthened,</p>\n<p>those houses we sold for $60,000 became worth $110,000. Foreclosure</p>\n<p>opportunities were still available, but became rare. It cost a valuable</p>\n<p>asset, my time, to go out looking for them. Thousands of buyers were</p>\n<p>looking for the few available deals. The market had changed. It was time</p>\n<p>to move on and look for other opportunities to put in the asset column.</p>\n<p>“You can’t do that here.” “That is against the law.” “You’re lying.”</p>\n<p>I hear those comments much more often than “Can you show me how</p>\n<p>to do that?” The math is simple. You do not need algebra or calculus.</p>\n<p>And the escrow company handles the legal transaction and the servicing</p>\n<p>of the payments. I have no roofs to fix or toilets to unplug because the</p>\n<p>owners do that. It’s their house. Occasionally someone does not pay.</p>\n<p>And that is wonderful because there are late fees, or they move out and</p>\n<p>the property is sold again. The court system handles that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>And it may not work in your area. The market conditions may be</p>\n<p>different. But the example illustrates how a simple financial process can</p>\n<p>create hundreds of thousands of dollars, with little money and low risk.</p>\n<p>It is an example of money being only an agreement. Anyone with a</p>\n<p>high school education can do it.</p>\n<p>Yet most people won’t. Most people listen to the standard advice of</p>\n<p>“Work hard and save money.”</p>\n<p>For about 30 hours of work, approximately $190,000 was created</p>\n<p>in the asset column, and no taxes were paid.</p>\n<h2>Which one sounds harder to you?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work hard. Pay 50% in taxes. Save what is left.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your savings then earn 5%, which is also taxed.</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the time to develop your financial intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Harness the power of your brain and the asset column.</p>\n<p>If you use option number one, be sure to factor in how much</p>\n<p>time it takes you to save $190,000. Time is one of your greatest assets.</p>\n<p>Now you may understand why I silently shake my head when</p>\n<p>I hear parents say, “My child is doing well in school and receiving</p>\n<p>a good education.” It may be good, but is it adequate?</p>\n<p>I know the above investment strategy is a small one. It is used</p>\n<p>to illustrate how small can grow into big. Again, my success reflects</p>\n<p>the importance of a strong financial foundation, which starts with</p>\n<p>a strong financial education.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>I have said it before, but it’s worth repeating. Financial intelligence</p>\n<p>is made up of these four main technical skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accounting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accounting is financial literacy, or the ability to read</p>\n<p>numbers. This is a vital skill if you want to build</p>\n<p>businesses or investments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Investing is the science of money making money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding markets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding markets is the science of supply and</p>\n<p>demand Alexander Graham Bell gave the market what it</p>\n<p>wanted. So did Bill Gates. A $75,000 house offered for</p>\n<p>$60,000 that cost $20,000 was also the result of seizing</p>\n<p>an opportunity created by the market. Somebody was</p>\n<p>buying, and someone was selling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The law</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The law is the awareness of accounting corporate, state and</p>\n<p>federal regulations. I recommend playing by the rules.</p>\n<p>It is this basic foundation, or the combination of these skills,</p>\n<p>that is needed to be successful in the pursuit of wealth, whether it be</p>\n<p>through the buying of small homes, apartment buildings, companies,</p>\n<p>stocks, bonds, precious metals, baseball cards, or the like.</p>\n<p>A few years later, the real estate market rebounded and everyone</p>\n<p>else was getting in. The stock market was booming, and everyone</p>\n<p>was getting in. The U.S. economy was getting back on its feet. I</p>\n<p>began selling and was now traveling to Peru, Norway, Malaysia, and</p>\n<p>the Philippines. The investment landscape had changed. We were no</p>\n<p>longer buying real estate. Now I just watch the values climb inside</p>\n<p>the asset column and will probably begin selling. I suspect that some</p>\n<p>of those six little house deals will sell and the $40,000 note will be</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>converted to cash. I need to call my accountant to be prepared for</p>\n<p>cash and seek ways to shelter it.</p>\n<p>The point I would like to make is that investments come and go.</p>\n<p>The market goes up and comes down. Economies improve and crash.</p>\n<p>The world is always handing you opportunities of a lifetime, every day</p>\n<p>of your life, but all too often we fail to see them. But they are there. And</p>\n<p>the more the world changes and the more technology changes, the more</p>\n<p>opportunities there will be to allow you and your family to be financially</p>\n<p>secure for generations to come.</p>\n<p>So why bother developing your financial intelligence? Again, only</p>\n<p>you can answer that. I know why I continue to learn and develop. I do</p>\n<p>it because I know there are changes coming. I’d rather welcome change</p>\n<p>than cling to the past. I know there will be market booms and market</p>\n<p>crashes. I want to continually develop my financial intelligence because,</p>\n<p>at each market change, some people will be on their knees begging</p>\n<p>for their jobs. Others, meanwhile, will take the lemons that life hands</p>\n<p>them—and we are all handed lemons occasionally—and turn them into</p>\n<p>millions. That’s financial intelligence.</p>\n<p>I am often asked about the lemons I have turned into millions.</p>\n<p>I hesitate using many more examples of personal investments because</p>\n<p>I am afraid it comes across as bragging or tooting my own horn.</p>\n<p>That is not my intention. I use the examples only as numerical</p>\n<p>and chronological illustrations of actual and simple cases. I use the</p>\n<p>examples because I want you to know that it is easy. And the more</p>\n<p>familiar you become with the four pillars of financial intelligence, the</p>\n<p>easier it becomes.</p>\n<p>Personally, I use two main vehicles to achieve financial growth:</p>\n<p>real estate and small-cap stocks. I use real estate as my foundation.</p>\n<p>Day in and day out, my properties provide cash flow and occasional</p>\n<p>spurts of growth in value. The small-cap stocks are used for fast growth.</p>\n<p>I do not recommend anything that I do. The examples are just</p>\n<p>that—examples. If the opportunity is too complex and I do not</p>\n<p>understand the investment, I don’t do it. Simple math and common</p>\n<p>sense are all you need to do well financially.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>There are five reasons for using examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To inspire people to learn more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To let people know it is easy if the foundation is strong.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To show that anyone can achieve great wealth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To show that there are millions of ways to achieve your goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To show that it’s not rocket science.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 1989, I used to jog through a lovely neighborhood in Portland,</p>\n<p>Oregon. It was a suburb that had little gingerbread houses. They</p>\n<p>were small and cute. I almost expected to see Little Red Riding Hood</p>\n<p>skipping down the sidewalk on her way to Granny’s.</p>\n<p>There were “For Sale” signs everywhere. The timber market was</p>\n<p>terrible, the stock market had just crashed, and the economy was</p>\n<p>depressed. On one street, I noticed a for-sale sign that was up longer</p>\n<p>than most. It looked old. Jogging past it one day, I ran into the</p>\n<p>owner, who looked troubled.</p>\n<p>“What are you asking for your house?” I asked.</p>\n<p>The owner turned and smiled weakly. “Make me an offer,” he said.</p>\n<p>“It’s been for sale for over a year. Nobody even comes by anymore to</p>\n<p>look at it.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll look,” I said, and I bought the house a half hour later for</p>\n<p>$20,000 less than his asking price.</p>\n<p>It was a cute little two-bedroom home, with gingerbread trim on</p>\n<p>all the windows. It was light blue with gray accents and had been built</p>\n<p>in 1930. Inside there was a beautiful rock fireplace, as well as two tiny</p>\n<p>bedrooms. It was a perfect rental house.</p>\n<p>I gave the owner $5,000 down for a $45,000 house that was really</p>\n<p>worth $65,000, except that no one wanted to buy it. The owner moved</p>\n<p>out in a week, happy to be free, and my first tenant moved in, a local</p>\n<p>college professor. After the mortgage, expenses, and management fees</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>were paid, I put a little less than $40 in my pocket at the end of each</p>\n<p>month. Hardly exciting.</p>\n<p>A year later, the depressed Oregon real estate market had begun</p>\n<p>to pick up. California investors, flush with money from their still</p>\n<p>booming real estate market, were moving north and buying up Oregon</p>\n<p>and Washington. I sold that little house for $95,000 to a young</p>\n<p>couple from California who thought it was a bargain. My capital</p>\n<p>gains of approximately $40,000 were placed into a 1031 tax-deferred</p>\n<p>exchange, and I went shopping for a place to put my money. In about</p>\n<p>a month, I found a 12-unit apartment house right next to the Intel</p>\n<p>plant in Beaverton, Oregon. The owners lived in Germany, had no idea</p>\n<p>what the place was worth, and again,</p>\n<h2>The problem with</h2>\n<p>just wanted to get out of it. I offered</p>\n<h2>“secure” investments</h2>\n<p>$275,000 for a $450,000 building.</p>\n<p>is that they are often They agreed to $300,000. I bought it</p>\n<p>sanitized, that is, and held it for two years. Utilizing the</p>\n<p>made so safe that the same 1031-exchange process, we sold</p>\n<p>gains are less. the building for $495,000 and bought a</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unit apartment building in Phoenix,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arizona. We had moved to Phoenix by then to get out of the rain, and</p>\n<p>needed to sell anyway. Like the former Oregon market, the real estate</p>\n<p>market in Phoenix was depressed. The price of the 30-unit apartment</p>\n<p>building in Phoenix was $875,000, with $225,000 down. The cash</p>\n<p>flow from the 30 units was a little over $5,000 a month.</p>\n<p>The Arizona market began moving up and, a few years later, a</p>\n<p>Colorado investor offered us $1.2 million for the property.</p>\n<p>The point of this example is how a small amount can grow into</p>\n<p>a large amount. Again, it is a matter of understanding financial</p>\n<p>statements, investment strategies, a sense of the market, and the laws.</p>\n<p>If people are not versed in these subjects, then obviously they must</p>\n<p>follow standard dogma, which is to play it safe, diversify, and only</p>\n<p>invest in secure investments. The problem with “secure” investments is</p>\n<p>that they are often sanitized, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>Most large brokerage houses will not touch speculative transactions</p>\n<p>in order to protect themselves and their clients. And that is a wise policy.</p>\n<p>The really hot deals are not offered to people who are novices. Often,</p>\n<p>the best deals that make the rich even richer are reserved for those who</p>\n<p>understand the game. It is technically illegal to offer speculative deals to</p>\n<p>someone who is considered not sophisticated, but of course it happens.</p>\n<p>The more sophisticated I get, the more opportunities come my way.</p>\n<p>Another case for developing your financial intelligence over a</p>\n<p>lifetime is simply that more opportunities are presented to you. And</p>\n<p>the greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell whether</p>\n<p>a deal is good. It’s your intelligence that can spot a bad deal, or make</p>\n<p>a bad deal good. The more I learn—and there is a lot to learn—the</p>\n<p>more money I make simply because I gain experience and wisdom as</p>\n<p>the years go on. I have friends who are playing it safe, working hard at</p>\n<p>their profession, and failing to gain financial wisdom, which does take</p>\n<p>time to develop.</p>\n<p>My overall philosophy is to plant seeds inside my asset column</p>\n<p>That is my formula. I start small and plant seeds. Some grow; some</p>\n<p>don’t. Inside our real estate corporation, we have property worth several</p>\n<p>million dollars. It is our own REIT, or real estate investment trust.</p>\n<p>The point I’m making is that most of those millions started out</p>\n<p>as little $5,000 to $10,000 investments. All of those down payments</p>\n<p>were fortunate to catch a fast-rising market and increase tax-free. We</p>\n<p>traded in and out several times over a number of years.</p>\n<p>We also own a stock portfolio, surrounded by a corporation that</p>\n<p>Kim and I call our “personal mutual fund.” We have friends who deal</p>\n<p>specifically with investors like us who have extra money each month</p>\n<p>to invest. We buy high-risk, speculative private companies that are</p>\n<p>just about to go public on a stock exchange in the United States or</p>\n<p>Canada. An example of how fast gains can be made are 100,000 shares</p>\n<p>purchased for 25 cents each before the company goes public. Six</p>\n<p>months later, the company is listed, and the 100,000 shares now are</p>\n<p>worth $2 each. If the company is well managed, the price keeps going</p>\n<p>up, and the stock may go to $20 or more per share. There are years</p>\n<p>when our $25,000 has gone to a million in less than a year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing. It is gambling</p>\n<p>if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying. The idea in</p>\n<p>anything is to use your technical knowledge, wisdom, and love of</p>\n<p>the game to cut the odds down, to lower the risk. Of course, there is</p>\n<p>always risk. It is financial intelligence that improves the odds. Thus,</p>\n<p>what is risky for one person is less risky to someone else. That is the</p>\n<p>primary reason I constantly encourage people to invest more in their</p>\n<p>financial education than in stocks, real estate, or other markets. The</p>\n<p>smarter you are, the better chance you have of beating the odds.</p>\n<p>The stock plays I personally invested in were extremely high-risk for</p>\n<p>most people and absolutely not recommended. I have been playing that</p>\n<p>game since 1979 and have paid more than my share in dues. But if you</p>\n<p>will reread why investments such as these are high-risk for most people,</p>\n<p>you may be able to set your life up differently, so that the ability to take</p>\n<p>$25,000 and turn it into $1 million in a year is low-risk for you.</p>\n<p>As stated earlier, nothing I have written is a recommendation. It</p>\n<p>is only used as an example of what is simple and possible. What I do</p>\n<p>is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things. Yet for the average</p>\n<p>individual, a passive income of more</p>\n<p>It is not gambling if than $100,000 a year is nice and not</p>\n<p>you know what you’re hard to achieve. Depending on the</p>\n<p>doing. It is gambling market and how smart you are, it could</p>\n<p>if you’re just throwing be done in five to 10 years. If you keep</p>\n<p>money into a deal your living expenses modest, $100,000</p>\n<h2>and praying.   coming in as additional income is</h2>\n<p>pleasant, regardless of whether you</p>\n<p>work. You can work if you like or take time off if you choose and use</p>\n<p>the government tax system in your favor, rather than against you.</p>\n<p>My personal basis is real estate. I love real estate because it’s stable</p>\n<p>and slow-moving. I keep the base solid. The cash flow is fairly steady</p>\n<p>and, if properly managed, has a good chance of increasing in value.</p>\n<p>The beauty of a solid base of real estate is that it allows me to take</p>\n<p>greater risks, as I do with speculative stocks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<p>If I make great profits in the stock market, I pay my capital-gains</p>\n<p>tax on the gain and then reinvest what’s left in real estate, again further</p>\n<p>securing my asset foundation.</p>\n<p>A last word on real estate: I have traveled all over the world and</p>\n<p>taught investing. In every city, I hear people say you cannot buy real</p>\n<p>estate cheap. That is not my experience. Even in New York or Tokyo,</p>\n<p>or just on the outskirts of the city, prime bargains are overlooked by</p>\n<p>most people. In Singapore,with their high real estate prices, there are</p>\n<p>still bargains to be found within a short driving distance. So whenever</p>\n<p>I hear someone say, “You can’t do that here,” pointing at me, I remind</p>\n<p>them that maybe the real statement is, “I don’t know how to do that</p>\n<p>here—yet.”</p>\n<p>Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen</p>\n<p>with your mind. Most people never get wealthy simply because they</p>\n<p>are not trained financially to recognize opportunities right in front</p>\n<p>of them.</p>\n<p>I am often asked, “How do I start?”</p>\n<p>In the final chapter of this book, I offer 10 steps that I followed</p>\n<p>on the road to my financial freedom. But always remember to have</p>\n<p>fun. When you learn the rules and the</p>\n<h2>Great opportunities</h2>\n<p>vocabulary of investing and begin to</p>\n<h2>are not seen</h2>\n<p>build your asset column, I think you’ll</p>\n<p>with your eyes. find that it’s as fun a game as you’ve</p>\n<h2>They are seen  ever played. Sometimes you win and</h2>\n<p>with your mind. sometimes you learn. But have fun. Most</p>\n<p>people never win because they’re more</p>\n<p>afraid of losing. That is why I found school so silly. In school we learn</p>\n<p>that mistakes are bad, and we are punished for making them. Yet if</p>\n<p>you look at the way humans are designed to learn, we learn by making</p>\n<p>mistakes. We learn to walk by falling down. If we never fell down, we</p>\n<p>would never walk. The same is true for learning to ride a bike. I still</p>\n<p>have scars on my knees, but today I can ride a bike without thinking.</p>\n<p>The same is true for getting rich. Unfortunately, the main reason most</p>\n<p>people are not rich is because they are terrified of losing. Winners are</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>not afraid of losing. But losers are. Failure is part of the process of</p>\n<p>success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.</p>\n<p>I look at money much like my game of tennis. I play hard, make</p>\n<p>mistakes, correct, make more mistakes, correct, and get better. If</p>\n<p>I lose the game, I reach across the net, shake my opponent’s hand,</p>\n<p>smile, and say, “See you next Saturday.”</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of investors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first and most common type is a person who buys a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>packaged investment. They call a retail outlet, such as a real</p>\n<p>estate company, a stockbroker, or a financial planner, and they</p>\n<p>buy something. It could be a mutual fund, a REIT, a stock or</p>\n<p>a bond. It is a clean and simple way of investing. An analogy</p>\n<p>would be a shopper who goes to a computer store and buys a</p>\n<p>computer right off the shelf.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second type is an investor who creates investments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This investor usually assembles a deal in the same way a</p>\n<p>person who buys components builds a computer. I do not</p>\n<p>know the first thing about putting components of a computer</p>\n<p>together, but I do know how to put pieces of opportunities</p>\n<p>together, or know people who know how.</p>\n<p>It is this second type of investor who is the more professional</p>\n<p>investor. Sometimes it may take years for all the pieces to come</p>\n<p>together. And sometimes they never do. It’s this second type of investor</p>\n<p>that my rich dad encouraged me to be. It is important to learn how to</p>\n<p>put the pieces together, because that is where the huge wins reside, and</p>\n<p>sometimes some huge losses if the tide goes against you.</p>\n<p>If you want to be the second type of investor, you need to develop</p>\n<p>three main skills.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Five: Lesson 5</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find an opportunity that everyone else missed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You see with your mind what others miss with their eyes.</p>\n<p>For example, a friend bought this rundown old house. It was</p>\n<p>spooky to look at. Everyone wondered why he bought it.</p>\n<p>What he saw that we did not was that the house came with</p>\n<p>four extra empty lots. He discovered that after going to the</p>\n<p>title company. After buying the house, he tore the house</p>\n<p>down and sold the five lots to a builder for three times what</p>\n<p>he paid for the entire package. He made $75,000 for two</p>\n<p>months of work. It’s not a lot of money, but it sure beats</p>\n<p>minimum wage. And it’s not technically difficult.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raise money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The average person only goes to the bank. This second type</p>\n<p>of investor needs to know how to raise capital, and there are</p>\n<p>many ways that don’t require a bank. To get started, I learned</p>\n<p>how to buy houses without a bank. It was the learned skill</p>\n<p>of raising money, more than the houses themselves, that</p>\n<p>was priceless.</p>\n<p>All too often I hear people say, “The bank won’t lend me</p>\n<p>money,” or “I don’t have the money to buy it.” If you want to</p>\n<p>be a type-two investor, you need to learn how to do that which</p>\n<p>stops most people. In other words, a majority of people let their</p>\n<p>lack of money stop them from making a deal. If you can avoid</p>\n<p>that obstacle, you will be millions ahead of those who don’t</p>\n<p>learn those skills. There have been many times I have bought</p>\n<p>a house, a stock, or an apartment building without a penny in</p>\n<p>the bank. I once bought an apartment house for $1.2 million.</p>\n<p>I did what is called “tying it up,” with a written contract</p>\n<p>between seller and buyer.</p>\n<p>I then raised the $100,000 deposit, which bought me 90 days</p>\n<p>to raise the rest of the money. Why did I do it? Simply because</p>\n<p>I knew it was worth $2 million. I never raised the money.</p>\n<p>Instead,the person who put up the $100,000 gave me $50,000</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>for finding the deal, took over my position, and I walked</p>\n<p>away. Total working time: three days. Again, it’s what you</p>\n<p>know more than what you buy. Investing is not buying. It’s</p>\n<p>more a case of knowing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize smart people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Intelligent people are those who work with or hire a</p>\n<p>person who is more intelligent than they are. When you</p>\n<p>need advice, make sure you choose your advisor wisely.</p>\n<p>There is a lot to learn, but the rewards can be astronomical. If you</p>\n<p>do not want to learn those skills, then being a type-one investor is highly</p>\n<p>recommended. It is what you know that is your greatest wealth. It is what</p>\n<p>you do not know that is your greatest risk.</p>\n<p>There is always risk, so learn to manage risk instead of avoiding it.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Six</h2>\n<h2>LESSON       6:  WORK       TO    LEARN      —</h2>\n<h2>DON\'T      WORK        FOR    MONEY</h2>\n<h2>Job security meant everything to my educated dad.</h2>\n<h2>Learning meant everything to my rich dad.</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, I granted an interview with a newspaper in</p>\n<p>Singapore. The young female reporter was on time, and the interview</p>\n<p>got under way immediately. We sat in the lobby of a luxurious hotel,</p>\n<p>sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore.</p>\n<p>I was to share the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was speaking on</p>\n<p>motivation, and I was speaking on “The Secrets of the Rich.”</p>\n<p>“Someday, I would like to be a best-selling author like you,” she</p>\n<p>said. I had seen some of the articles she had written for the paper, and</p>\n<p>I was impressed. She had a tough, clear style of writing. Her articles</p>\n<p>held a reader’s interest.</p>\n<p>“You have a great style,” I said in reply. “What holds you back</p>\n<p>from achieving your dream?”</p>\n<p>“My work does not seem to go anywhere,” she said quietly.</p>\n<p>“Everyone says that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens.</p>\n<p>So I keep my job with the paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you</p>\n<p>have any suggestions?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I do,” I said brightly. “A friend of mine here in Singapore</p>\n<p>runs a school that trains people to sell. He runs sales-training courses</p>\n<p>for many of the top corporations here in Singapore, and I think</p>\n<p>attending one of his courses would greatly enhance your career.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>She stiffened. “Are you saying I should go to school to learn to sell?”</p>\n<p>I nodded.</p>\n<p>“You aren’t serious, are you?”</p>\n<p>Again, I nodded. “What is wrong with that?” I was now back-</p>\n<p>pedaling. She was offended by something, and now I was wishing</p>\n<p>I had not said anything. In my attempt to be helpful, I found myself</p>\n<p>defending my suggestion. “I have a master’s degree in English</p>\n<p>Literature. Why would I go to school to learn to be a salesperson?</p>\n<p>I am a professional. I went to school to be trained in a profession so</p>\n<p>I would not have to be a sales person. I hate salespeople. All they</p>\n<p>want is money. So tell me why I should study sales?” She was packing</p>\n<p>her briefcase. The interview was over.</p>\n<p>On the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote.</p>\n<p>I picked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad.</p>\n<p>“Do you see this?” I said pointing to her notes.</p>\n<p>She looked down at her notes. “What?” she said, confused.</p>\n<p>Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes. On her pad she had</p>\n<p>written: “Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author.”</p>\n<p>“It says best-selling author, not best-writing author,” I said quietly.</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened.</p>\n<p>“I am a terrible writer,” I said. “You are a great writer. I went to</p>\n<p>sales school. You have a master’s degree. Put them together and you get</p>\n<p>a ‘best-selling author’ and a ‘best-writing author.’”</p>\n<p>Anger flared from her eyes. “I’ll never stoop so low as to learn how</p>\n<p>to sell. People like you have no business writing. I am a professionally</p>\n<p>trained writer and you are a salesman. It is not fair,” she fumed.</p>\n<p>She put the rest of her notes away and hurried out through the large</p>\n<p>glass doors into the humid Singapore morning.</p>\n<p>At least she gave me a fair and favorable write-up the next morning.</p>\n<p>The world is filled with smart, talented, educated, and gifted people. We</p>\n<p>meet them every day. They are all around us.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, my car was not running well. I pulled into a garage,</p>\n<p>and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew</p>\n<p>what was wrong by simply listening to the engine. I was amazed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>I am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn. I have</p>\n<p>met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than $20,000 a year.</p>\n<p>A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling</p>\n<p>me how many doctors, dentists, and chiropractors struggle financially.</p>\n<p>All this time, I thought that when they graduated, the dollars would</p>\n<p>pour in. It was this business consultant who gave me the phrase: “They</p>\n<p>are one skill away from great wealth.”</p>\n<p>What this phrase means is that most people need only to learn</p>\n<p>and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially.</p>\n<p>I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a synergy of</p>\n<p>accounting, investing, marketing, and law. Combine those four</p>\n<p>technical skills and making money with money is easier than most</p>\n<p>people would believe. When it comes to money, the only skill most</p>\n<p>people know is to work hard.</p>\n<p>The classic example of a synergy of skills was that young writer for</p>\n<p>the newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing,</p>\n<p>her income would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some</p>\n<p>courses in advertising copywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of</p>\n<p>working at the newspaper, I would seek a job at an advertising agency.</p>\n<p>Even if it were a cut in pay, she would learn how to communicate in</p>\n<p>short-cuts that are used in successful advertising. She also would spend</p>\n<p>time learning public relations, an important skill. She would learn how</p>\n<p>to get millions in free publicity. Then, at night and on weekends, she</p>\n<p>could be writing her great novel. When it was finished, she would be</p>\n<p>better able to sell her book. Then, in a short while, she could be a “best-</p>\n<p>selling author.”</p>\n<p>When I came out with my first book, If You Want To Be Rich and</p>\n<p>Happy, Don’t Go to School, a publisher suggested I change the title to</p>\n<p>The Economics of Education. I told the publisher that, with a title like</p>\n<p>that, I would sell two books: one to my family, and one to my best</p>\n<p>friend. The problem is that they would expect it for free. The obnoxious</p>\n<p>title, If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, Don’t Go to School, was chosen</p>\n<p>because we knew it would get tons of publicity. I am pro-education and</p>\n<p>believe in education reform. If I were not pro-education, why would</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>I continue to press for changing our antiquated educational system? So</p>\n<p>I chose a title that would get me on more TV and radio shows, simply</p>\n<p>because I was willing to be controversial. Many people thought I was a</p>\n<p>fruitcake, but the book sold and sold.</p>\n<p>When I graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in</p>\n<ul>\n<li>, my educated dad was happy. Standard Oil of California had</li>\n</ul>\n<p>hired me for its oil-tanker fleet as a third mate. The pay was low</p>\n<p>compared with my classmates, but it was okay for a first real job</p>\n<p>after college. My starting pay was about $42,000 a year, including</p>\n<p>overtime, and I only had to work for seven months. I had five</p>\n<p>months of vacation. If I had wanted to, I could have taken the run to</p>\n<p>Vietnam with a subsidiary shipping company and easily doubled my</p>\n<p>pay instead of taking five months of vacation.</p>\n<p>I had a great career ahead of me, yet I resigned after six months</p>\n<p>with the company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly.</p>\n<p>My educated dad was devastated. Rich dad congratulated me.</p>\n<p>In school and in the workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of</p>\n<p>specialization: that is, in order to make more money or get promoted,</p>\n<p>you need to specialize. That is why medical doctors immediately</p>\n<p>begin to seek a specialty such as</p>\n<p>“You want to know orthopedics or pediatrics. The same</p>\n<p>a little about a lot” is true for accountants, architects,</p>\n<h2>was rich dad’s lawyers, pilots, and others.</h2>\n<p>suggestion.      My educated dad believed in the same</p>\n<p>dogma. That is why he was thrilled when</p>\n<p>he eventually achieved his doctorate. He often admitted that schools</p>\n<p>reward people who study more and more about less and less.</p>\n<p>Rich dad encouraged me to do exactly the opposite. “You want</p>\n<p>to know a little about a lot” was his suggestion. That is why for years</p>\n<p>I worked in different areas of his companies. For a while, I worked in</p>\n<p>his accounting department. Although I would probably never have</p>\n<p>been an accountant, he wanted me to learn via osmosis. Rich dad</p>\n<p>knew I would pick up jargon and a sense of what is important and</p>\n<p>what is not. I also worked as a bus boy and construction worker as</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>well as in sales, reservations, and marketing. He was grooming Mike</p>\n<p>and me. That is why he insisted we sit in on the meetings with his</p>\n<p>bankers, lawyers, accountants, and brokers. He wanted us to know a</p>\n<p>little about every aspect of his empire.</p>\n<p>When I quit my high-paying job with Standard Oil, my educated</p>\n<p>dad had a heart-to-heart talk with me. He was bewildered. He could</p>\n<p>not understand my decision to resign from a career that offered high</p>\n<p>pay, great benefits, lots of time off, and opportunity for promotion.</p>\n<p>When he asked me one evening, “Why did you quit?” I could not</p>\n<p>explain it to him, though I tried hard to. My logic did not fit his</p>\n<p>logic. The big problem was that my logic was my rich dad’s logic.</p>\n<p>Job security meant everything to my educated dad. Learning meant</p>\n<p>everything to my rich dad.</p>\n<p>Educated dad thought I went to school to learn to be a ship’s</p>\n<p>officer. Rich dad knew that I went to school to study international</p>\n<p>trade. So as a student, I made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil</p>\n<p>tankers, and passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich</p>\n<p>dad emphasized that I should stay in the Pacific instead of taking ships</p>\n<p>to Europe because he knew that the emerging nations were in Asia, not</p>\n<p>Europe. While most of my classmates, including Mike, were partying at</p>\n<p>their fraternity houses, I was studying trade, people, business styles, and</p>\n<p>cultures in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam,</p>\n<p>Korea, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Philippines. I was partying also, but it</p>\n<p>was not in any frat house. I grew up rapidly.</p>\n<p>Educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and</p>\n<p>join the Marine Corps. I told him I wanted to learn to fly, but really</p>\n<p>I wanted to learn to lead troops. Rich dad explained to me that the</p>\n<p>hardest part of running a company is managing people. He had spent</p>\n<p>three years in the Army; my educated dad was draft-exempt. Rich dad</p>\n<p>valued learning to lead men into dangerous situations. “Leadership is</p>\n<p>what you need to learn next,” he said. “If you’re not a good leader,</p>\n<p>you’ll get shot in the back, just like they do in business.”</p>\n<p>Returning from Vietnam in 1973, I resigned my commission, even</p>\n<p>though I loved flying. I found a job with Xerox Corp. I joined it for</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>one reason, and it was not for the benefits. I was a shy person, and the</p>\n<p>thought of selling was the most frightening subject in the world. Xerox</p>\n<p>has one of the best sales-training programs in America.</p>\n<p>Rich dad was proud of me. My educated dad was ashamed. Being</p>\n<p>an intellectual, he thought that salespeople were below him. I worked</p>\n<p>with Xerox for four years until I overcame my fear of knocking on</p>\n<p>doors and being rejected. Once I could consistently be in the top five</p>\n<p>in sales, I again resigned and moved on, leaving behind another great</p>\n<p>career with an excellent company.</p>\n<p>In 1977, I formed my first company. Rich dad had groomed</p>\n<p>Mike and me to take over companies. So I now had to learn to form</p>\n<p>them and put them together. My first product, the nylon-and-Velcro</p>\n<p>wallet, was manufactured in the Far East and shipped to a warehouse</p>\n<p>in New York, near where I had gone</p>\n<p>to school. My formal education was</p>\n<h2>Job is an acronym for</h2>\n<p>complete, and it was time to test my</p>\n<h2>“Just Over Broke.”</h2>\n<p>wings. If I failed, I would go broke.</p>\n<p>Rich dad thought it best to go broke</p>\n<p>before 30. “You still have time to recover” was his advice. On the eve</p>\n<p>of my 30th birthday, my first shipment left Korea for New York.</p>\n<p>Today, I still do business internationally. And as my rich dad</p>\n<p>encouraged me to do, I keep seeking the emerging nations. Today my</p>\n<p>investment company invests in South American countries and Asian</p>\n<p>countries, as well as in Norway and Russia.</p>\n<p>There is an old cliché that goes: “Job is an acronym for ‘Just Over</p>\n<p>Broke.’” Unfortunately, I would say that applies to millions of people.</p>\n<p>Because school does not think financial intelligence is an intelligence,</p>\n<p>most workers live within their means. They work and they pay the bills.</p>\n<p>There is another horrible management theory that goes, “Workers</p>\n<p>work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that</p>\n<p>workers won’t quit.” And if you look at the pay scales of most companies,</p>\n<p>again I would say there is a degree of truth to that statement.</p>\n<p>The net result is that most workers never get ahead. They do what</p>\n<p>they’ve been taught to do: Get a secure job. Most workers focus on</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>working for pay and benefits that reward them in the short term, but</p>\n<p>are often disastrous in the long run.</p>\n<p>Instead, I recommend to young people to seek work for what they</p>\n<p>will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down the road at</p>\n<p>what skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession</p>\n<p>and before getting trapped in the Rat Race.</p>\n<p>Once people are trapped in the lifelong process of bill-paying,</p>\n<p>they become like those little hamsters running around in those metal</p>\n<p>wheels. Their little furry legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is</p>\n<p>turning furiously, but come tomorrow morning, they’ll still be in</p>\n<p>the same cage. Great job.</p>\n<p>In the movie Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise, there are many</p>\n<p>great one-liners. Probably the most memorable is: “Show me the</p>\n<p>money.” But there is one line I thought most truthful. It comes from</p>\n<p>the scene where Tom Cruise is leaving the firm. He has just been fired,</p>\n<p>and he is asking the entire company, “Who wants to come with me?”</p>\n<p>And the whole place is silent and frozen. Only one woman speaks up</p>\n<p>and says, “I’d like to, but I’m due for a promotion in three months.”</p>\n<p>That statement is probably the most truthful statement in the whole</p>\n<p>movie. It is the type of statement that people use to keep themselves busy,</p>\n<p>working away to pay bills. I know my educated dad looked forward to his</p>\n<p>pay raise every year, and every year he was disappointed. So he would go</p>\n<p>back to school to earn more qualifications so he could get another raise.</p>\n<p>Then, once again, there would be another disappointment.</p>\n<p>The question I often ask people is, “Where is this daily activity</p>\n<p>taking you?” Just like the little hamster, I wonder if people look at</p>\n<p>where their hard work is taking them. What does the future hold?</p>\n<p>In his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: “I visited</p>\n<p>the headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met</p>\n<p>with a managing director who specializes in designing lush retirement</p>\n<p>plans for top management. When I asked her what people who don’t</p>\n<p>have corner offices will be able to expect in the way of pension income,</p>\n<p>she said with a confident smile, ‘The Silver Bullet’.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>“What, I asked, is ‘The Silver Bullet?’”</p>\n<p>“She shrugged and said, ‘If baby boomers discover they don’t have</p>\n<p>enough money to live on when they’re older, they can always blow</p>\n<p>their brains out.’”</p>\n<p>Karpel goes on to explain the difference between the old defined-</p>\n<p>benefit retirement plans and the new 401(k) plans that are riskier. It</p>\n<p>is not a pretty picture for most people working today. And that is just</p>\n<p>for retirement. Add medical fees and long-term nursing-home care</p>\n<p>and the picture is frightening.</p>\n<p>Already, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine</p>\n<p>need to make tough decisions such as, “Who will live, and who will</p>\n<p>die?” They make those decisions purely on how much money they</p>\n<p>have and how old the patients are. If the patient is old, they often will</p>\n<p>give the medical care to someone younger. The older poor patient</p>\n<p>gets put to the back of the line. Just as the rich can afford better</p>\n<p>education, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, while those</p>\n<p>who have little wealth will die.</p>\n<p>So I wonder: Are workers looking into the future or just until</p>\n<p>their next paycheck, never questioning where they are headed?</p>\n<p>When I speak to adults who want to earn more money, I always</p>\n<p>recommend the same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life.</p>\n<p>Instead of simply working for the money and security, which I admit</p>\n<p>are important, I suggest they take a second job that will teach them</p>\n<p>a second skill. Often I recommend joining a network-marketing</p>\n<p>company, also called multilevel marketing, if they want to learn sales</p>\n<p>skills. Some of these companies have excellent training programs that</p>\n<p>help people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which are the</p>\n<p>main reasons people are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable</p>\n<h2>than money, in the long run.</h2>\n<p>When I offer this suggestion, I often hear in response, “Oh that is</p>\n<p>too much hassle,” or “I only want to do what I am interested in.”</p>\n<p>If they say, “It’s too much of a hassle,” I ask, “So you would</p>\n<p>rather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the</p>\n<p>government?” If they tell me, “I only do what I am interested in,”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>I say, “I’m not interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want</p>\n<p>to feel better and live longer.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement, “You can’t</p>\n<p>teach an old dog new tricks.” Unless a person is used to changing, it’s</p>\n<p>hard to change.</p>\n<p>But for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes</p>\n<p>to the idea of working to learn something new, I offer this word</p>\n<p>of encouragement: Life is much like going to the gym. The most</p>\n<p>painful part is deciding to go. Once you get past that, it’s easy. There</p>\n<p>have been many days I have dreaded going to the gym, but once I am</p>\n<p>there and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is over, I am</p>\n<p>always glad I talked myself into going.</p>\n<p>If you are unwilling to work to learn something new and instead</p>\n<p>insist on becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the</p>\n<p>company you work for is unionized. Labor unions are designed to</p>\n<p>protect specialists. My educated dad, after falling from grace with</p>\n<p>the governor, became the head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He</p>\n<p>told me that it was the hardest job he ever held. My rich dad, on the</p>\n<p>other hand, spent his life doing his best to keep his companies from</p>\n<p>becoming unionized. He was successful. Although the unions came</p>\n<p>close, rich dad was always able to fight them off.</p>\n<p>Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and</p>\n<p>the benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become</p>\n<p>highly specialized. Then seek union protection. For example, had I</p>\n<p>continued with my flying career, I would have sought a company that</p>\n<p>had a strong pilots union. Why? Because my life would be dedicated</p>\n<p>to learning a skill that was valuable in only one industry. If I were</p>\n<p>pushed out of that industry, my life’s skills would not be as valuable</p>\n<p>to another industry. A displaced senior pilot—with 100,000 hours of</p>\n<p>heavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year—would have a</p>\n<p>hard time finding an equivalent high-paying job teaching in school.</p>\n<p>Skills do not necessarily transfer from industry to industry. Skills the</p>\n<p>pilots are paid for in the airline industry are not as important in, say,</p>\n<p>the school system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>The same is true even for doctors today. With all the changes in</p>\n<p>medicine, many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical</p>\n<p>organizations such as HMOs. Schoolteachers definitely need to be</p>\n<p>union members. Today in America, the teachers union is the largest</p>\n<p>and the richest labor union of all. The NEA, the National Education</p>\n<p>Association, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need the</p>\n<p>protection of their union because their skills are also of limited value</p>\n<p>to an industry outside of education. So the rule of thumb is: “Highly</p>\n<p>specialized; then unionize.” It’s the smart thing to do.</p>\n<p>When I ask the classes I teach, “How many of you can cook a</p>\n<p>better hamburger than McDonald’s?” almost all the students</p>\n<p>raise their hands. I then ask, “So if most of you can cook a better</p>\n<p>hamburger, how come McDonald’s makes more money than you?”</p>\n<p>The answer is obvious: McDonald’s is excellent at business</p>\n<p>systems. The reason so many talented people are poor is because they</p>\n<p>focus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing</p>\n<p>about business systems.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable</p>\n<p>amount of money. One day his mother’s attorney called to tell him</p>\n<p>that she had left him $35,000. That is what was left of her estate after</p>\n<p>the attorney and the government took their shares. Immediately, he</p>\n<p>saw an opportunity to increase his business by using some of this</p>\n<p>money to advertise. Two months later, his first four-color, full-page</p>\n<p>ad appeared in an expensive magazine that targeted the very rich.</p>\n<p>The ad ran for three months. He received no replies from the ad,</p>\n<p>and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the</p>\n<p>magazine for misrepresentation.</p>\n<p>This is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful</p>\n<p>hamburger, but knows little about business. When I asked him what</p>\n<p>he learned, his only reply was, “Advertising salespeople are crooks.”</p>\n<p>I then asked him if he would be willing to take a course in sales and</p>\n<p>a course in direct marketing. His reply, “I don’t have the time, and I</p>\n<p>don’t want to waste my money.”</p>\n<p>The world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they’re</p>\n<p>poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>because of what they know, but because of what they do not know.</p>\n<p>They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger</p>\n<p>rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe</p>\n<p>McDonald’s does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best</p>\n<p>at selling and delivering a basic average burger.</p>\n<p>Poor dad wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to</p>\n<p>be paid more. Even after being told by the governor of Hawaii</p>\n<p>that he could no longer work in state government, my educated</p>\n<p>dad continued to encourage me to get specialized. Educated dad</p>\n<p>then took up the cause of the teachers’ union, campaigning for</p>\n<p>further protection and benefits for these highly skilled and educated</p>\n<p>professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that</p>\n<p>overspecialization is what caused the need for union protection. He</p>\n<p>never understood that the more specialized you become, the more</p>\n<p>you are trapped and dependent on that specialty.</p>\n<p>Rich dad advised that Mike and I groom ourselves. Many</p>\n<p>corporations do the same thing. They find a young bright student</p>\n<p>just out of business school and begin grooming that person to</p>\n<p>someday take over the company. So these bright young employees</p>\n<p>do not specialize in one department. They are moved from</p>\n<p>department to department to learn all the aspects of business systems.</p>\n<p>The rich often groom their children or the children of others. By</p>\n<p>doing so, their children gain an overall knowledge of the operations</p>\n<p>of the business and how the various departments interrelate.</p>\n<p>For the World War II generation, it was considered bad to skip</p>\n<p>from company to company. Today, it is considered smart. Since</p>\n<p>people will skip from company to company rather than seek greater</p>\n<p>specialization in skills, why not seek to learn more than to earn?</p>\n<p>In the short term, it may earn you less, but it will pay dividends in</p>\n<h2>the long term.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Six: Lesson 6</p>\n<p>The main management skills needed for success are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Management of cash flow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Management of systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Management of people</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most important specialized skills are sales and marketing.</p>\n<p>The ability to sell—to communicate to another human being, be it</p>\n<p>a customer, employee, boss, spouse, or child—is the base skill of</p>\n<p>personal success. Communication skills such as writing, speaking,</p>\n<p>and negotiating are crucial to a life of success. These are skills I work</p>\n<p>on constantly, attending courses or buying educational resources to</p>\n<p>expand my knowledge.</p>\n<p>As I have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder and harder</p>\n<p>the more competent he became. He also became more trapped the</p>\n<p>more specialized he got. Although his salary went up, his choices</p>\n<p>diminished. Soon after he was locked out of government work,</p>\n<p>he found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. It is like</p>\n<p>professional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play.</p>\n<p>Their once high-paying position is gone, and they have limited skills</p>\n<p>to fall back on. I think that is why my educated dad sided so much</p>\n<p>with the unions after that. He realized how much a union would have</p>\n<p>benefited him.</p>\n<p>Rich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot.</p>\n<p>He encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to</p>\n<p>bring smart people together to work as a team. Today it would be</p>\n<p>called a synergy of professional specialities.</p>\n<p>Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands</p>\n<p>of dollars a year. They earn that much because they have specialized</p>\n<p>skills in their field as well as other skills. They can teach, as well as</p>\n<p>sell and market. I know of no other skills to be more important than</p>\n<p>selling and marketing. The skills of selling and marketing are difficult</p>\n<p>for most people, primarily due to their fear of rejection. The better</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>you are at communicating, negotiating, and handling your fear of</p>\n<p>rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that newspaper writer who</p>\n<p>wanted to become a best-selling author, I advise anyone else today.</p>\n<p>Being technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses.</p>\n<p>I have friends who are geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively</p>\n<p>with other human beings and, as a result, their earnings are pitiful.</p>\n<p>I advise them to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn</p>\n<p>nothing, their communication skills will improve. And that is priceless.</p>\n<p>In addition to being good learners, sellers, and marketers, we</p>\n<p>need to be good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich,</p>\n<p>we need to be able to give as well as to receive. In cases of financial</p>\n<p>or professional struggle, there is often a lack of giving and receiving.</p>\n<p>I know many people who are poor because they are neither good</p>\n<p>students nor good teachers.</p>\n<p>Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to</p>\n<p>give first. Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave,</p>\n<p>the more they received. One glaring difference was in the giving of</p>\n<p>money. My rich dad gave lots of money away. He gave to his church,</p>\n<p>to charities, and to his foundation. He knew that to receive money,</p>\n<p>you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to most great</p>\n<p>wealthy families. That is why there are organizations like the Rockefeller</p>\n<p>Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These are organizations designed</p>\n<p>to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>My educated dad always said, “When I have some extra money,</p>\n<p>I’ll give it.” The problem was that there was never any extra. So he</p>\n<p>worked harder to draw more money in, rather than focus on the most</p>\n<p>important law of money: “Give, and you shall receive.” Instead, he</p>\n<p>believed in: “Receive, and then you give.”</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I became both dads. One part of me is a hard-core</p>\n<p>capitalist who loves the game of money making money. The other part</p>\n<p>is a socially responsible teacher who is deeply concerned with this ever-</p>\n<p>widening gap between the haves and have-nots. I personally hold the</p>\n<p>archaic educational system primarily responsible for this growing gap.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Seven</h2>\n<h2>OVERCOMING              OBSTACLES</h2>\n<h2>The primary difference between a rich person</h2>\n<h2>and a poor person is how they manage fear.</h2>\n<p>Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may</p>\n<p>still face roadblocks to becoming financially independent. There are</p>\n<p>five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop</p>\n<p>abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow. The five</p>\n<p>reasons are:</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Fear</h2>\n<p>I have never met anyone who really likes losing money. And in all</p>\n<p>my years, I have never met a rich person who has never lost money.</p>\n<p>But I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime—</p>\n<p>investing, that is.</p>\n<p>The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich.</p>\n<p>But it’s not having fear that is the problem. It’s how you handle fear.</p>\n<p>It’s how you handle losing. It’s how you handle failure that makes the</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>difference in one’s life. The primary difference between a rich person</p>\n<p>and a poor person is how they manage that fear.</p>\n<p>It’s okay to be fearful. It’s okay to be a coward when it comes</p>\n<p>to money. You can still be rich. We’re all heroes at something, and</p>\n<p>cowards at something else. My friend’s wife is an emergency-room</p>\n<p>nurse. When she sees blood, she flies into action. When I mention</p>\n<p>investing, she runs away. When I see blood, I don’t run. I pass out.</p>\n<p>My rich dad understood phobias about money. “Some people are</p>\n<p>terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. Both</p>\n<p>are phobias,” he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing</p>\n<p>money was this little rhyme: “If you hate risk and worry, start early.”</p>\n<p>If you start young, it’s easier to be rich. I won’t go into it here,</p>\n<p>but there is a staggering difference between a person who starts</p>\n<p>investing at age 20 versus age 30. The purchase of Manhattan Island</p>\n<p>is said to be one of the greatest bargains of all time. New York was</p>\n<p>purchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet if that $24 had been</p>\n<p>invested at 8 percent annually, that $24 would have been worth more</p>\n<p>than $28 trillion by 1995. Manhattan could be repurchased with</p>\n<p>money left over to buy much of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>But what if you don’t have much time left or would like to retire</p>\n<p>early? How do you handle the fear of losing money?</p>\n<p>My poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing</p>\n<p>to discuss the subject.</p>\n<p>My rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think</p>\n<p>like a Texan. “I like Texas and Texans,” he used to say. “In Texas,</p>\n<p>everything is bigger. When Texans win, they win big. And when</p>\n<p>they lose, it’s spectacular.”</p>\n<p>“They like losing?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“That’s not what I’m saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy</p>\n<p>loser, and I’ll show you a loser,” said rich dad. “It’s a Texan’s attitude</p>\n<p>toward risk, reward, and failure I’m talking about. It’s how they handle</p>\n<p>life. They live it big. Not like most of the people around here, living</p>\n<p>like roaches when it comes to money, terrified that someone will shine</p>\n<p>a light on them, and whimpering when the grocery clerk shortchanges</p>\n<p>them a quarter.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Rich dad went on. “What I like best is the Texas attitude. They’re</p>\n<p>proud when they win, and they brag when they lose. Texans have a</p>\n<p>saying, ‘If you’re going to go broke, go big.’ You don’t want to admit</p>\n<p>you went broke over a duplex.”</p>\n<p>He constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack</p>\n<p>of financial success was because most people played it too safe. “People</p>\n<p>are so afraid of losing that they lose” were his words.</p>\n<p>Fran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still</p>\n<p>another way: “Winning means being unafraid to lose.”</p>\n<p>In my own life, I’ve noticed that winning usually follows losing.</p>\n<p>Before I finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times.</p>\n<p>I’ve never met a golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I’ve never met</p>\n<p>people who have fallen in love who have never had their heart broken.</p>\n<p>And I’ve never met someone rich who has never lost money.</p>\n<p>So for most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because</p>\n<p>the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.</p>\n<p>Another saying in Texas is, “Everyone wants to go to heaven,</p>\n<p>but no one wants to die.” Most people dream of being rich, but are</p>\n<p>terrified of losing money. So they never</p>\n<h2>For most people, the</h2>\n<p>get to heaven.</p>\n<h2>reason they don’t win</h2>\n<p>Rich dad used to tell Mike and me</p>\n<h2>financially is because</h2>\n<p>stories about his trips to Texas. “If you</p>\n<p>the pain of losing money really want to learn the attitude of how</p>\n<p>is far greater than the to handle risk, losing, and failure, go to</p>\n<p>joy of being rich. San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The</p>\n<p>Alamo is a great story of brave people</p>\n<p>who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of success. They chose</p>\n<p>to die instead of surrendering. It’s an inspiring story worthy of study.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it’s still a tragic military defeat. They got their butts</p>\n<p>kicked. So how do Texans handle failure? They still shout, ‘Remember</p>\n<p>the Alamo!’”</p>\n<p>Mike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when</p>\n<p>he was about to go into a big deal, and he was nervous. After he had</p>\n<p>done all his due diligence and it was time to put up or shut up, he told</p>\n<p>us this story. Every time he was afraid of making a mistake or losing</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>money, he told us this story. It gave him strength, for it reminded him</p>\n<p>that he could always turn a financial loss into a financial win. Rich dad</p>\n<p>knew that failure would only make him stronger and smarter. It’s not</p>\n<p>that he wanted to lose. He just knew who he was and how he would</p>\n<p>take a loss. He would take a loss and make it a win. That’s what made</p>\n<p>him a winner and others losers. It gave him the courage to cross the line</p>\n<p>when others backed out. “That’s why I like Texans so much,” he would</p>\n<p>say. “They took a great failure and turned it into inspiration… as well a</p>\n<p>tourist destination that makes them millions.”</p>\n<p>But probably his words that mean the most to me today are these:</p>\n<p>“Texans don’t bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take</p>\n<p>their failures and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans</p>\n<p>to become winners. But that formula is not just the formula for Texans.</p>\n<p>It is the formula for all winners.”</p>\n<p>I’ve said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. I</p>\n<p>remember falling off only made me more determined to learn to ride,</p>\n<p>not less. I also said that I have never</p>\n<p>met a golfer who has never lost a ball.</p>\n<h2>Failure inspires winners.</h2>\n<p>For top professional golfers, losing</p>\n<h2>Failure defeats losers.</h2>\n<p>a ball or a tournament provides the</p>\n<p>inspiration to be better, to practice</p>\n<p>harder, to study more. That’s what makes them better. For winners,</p>\n<p>losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them.</p>\n<p>I like to quote John D. Rockefeller, who said, “I always tried to</p>\n<p>turn every disaster into an opportunity.”</p>\n<p>And being Japanese-American, I can say this. Many people say that</p>\n<p>Pearl Harbor was an American mistake. I say it was a Japanese mistake.</p>\n<p>From the movie, Tora, Tora, Tora, a somber Japanese admiral says to</p>\n<p>his cheering subordinates, “I am afraid we have awakened a sleeping</p>\n<p>giant.” “Remember Pearl Harbor” became a rallying cry. It turned one</p>\n<p>of America’s greatest losses into the reason to win. This great defeat</p>\n<p>gave America strength, and America soon emerged as a world power.</p>\n<p>Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest</p>\n<p>secret of winners. It’s the secret that losers do not know. The greatest</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>secret of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they’re not</p>\n<p>afraid of losing. Repeating Fran Tarkenton’s quote, “Winning means</p>\n<p>being unafraid to lose.” People like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of</p>\n<p>losing, because they know who they are. They hate losing, so they</p>\n<p>know that losing will only inspire them to become better. There is a</p>\n<p>big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. Most</p>\n<p>people are so afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke</p>\n<p>over a duplex. Financially, they play life too safe and too small.</p>\n<p>They buy big houses and big cars, but not big investments. The</p>\n<p>main reason that over 90 percent of the American public struggles</p>\n<p>financially is because they play not to lose. They don’t play to win.</p>\n<p>They go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers</p>\n<p>and buy a balanced portfolio. Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield</p>\n<p>bonds, mutual funds that can be traded within a mutual-fund family,</p>\n<p>and a few individual stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is</p>\n<p>not a winning portfolio. It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong. It’s probably a better portfolio than more</p>\n<p>than 70 percent of the population has, and that’s frightening. It’s</p>\n<p>a great portfolio for someone who loves safety. But playing it safe</p>\n<p>and balanced on your investment portfolio is not the way successful</p>\n<p>investors play the game. If you have little money and you want to</p>\n<p>be rich, you must first be focused, not balanced. If you look at any</p>\n<p>successful person, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people</p>\n<p>go nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first</p>\n<p>go unbalanced. Just look at how you make progress walking.</p>\n<p>Thomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was</p>\n<p>not balanced. He was focused. Donald Trump is focused. George Soros</p>\n<p>is focused. George Patton did not take his tanks wide. He focused them</p>\n<p>and blew through the weak spots in the German line. The French went</p>\n<p>wide with the Maginot Line, and you know what happened to them.</p>\n<p>If you have any desire to be rich, you must focus. Do not do</p>\n<p>what poor and middle-class people do: put their few eggs in many</p>\n<p>baskets. Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and FOCUS: Follow</p>\n<p>One Course Until Successful.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>If you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it</p>\n<p>safe. Go with balanced investments. If you’re over 25 years old and are</p>\n<p>terrified of taking risks, don’t change. Play it safe, but start early. Start</p>\n<p>accumulating your nest egg early because it will take time.</p>\n<p>But if you have dreams of freedom—of getting out of the Rat</p>\n<p>Race—the first question to ask yourself is, “How do I respond to</p>\n<p>failure?” If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for it—but</p>\n<p>only maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper</p>\n<p>tantrums—like spoiled brats who call attorneys to file lawsuits every</p>\n<p>time something doesn’t go their way—then play it safe. Keep your</p>\n<p>daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk</p>\n<p>in those financial instruments also, even though they may appear safe.</p>\n<p>I say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because</p>\n<p>stacking the asset column is easy. It’s really a low-aptitude game. It</p>\n<p>doesn’t take much education. Fifth-grade math will do. But building</p>\n<p>your asset column is a game in which attitude plays a major role. It</p>\n<p>takes guts, patience, and a great attitude toward failure. Losers avoid</p>\n<p>failing. And failure turns losers into winners. Just remember the Alamo.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Cynicism</h2>\n<p>“The sky is falling! The sky is falling!” Most of us know the</p>\n<p>story of Chicken Little who ran around warning the barnyard of</p>\n<p>impending doom. We all know people who are that way. There’s a</p>\n<p>Chicken Little inside each of us.</p>\n<p>As I stated earlier, the cynic is really a little chicken. We all get</p>\n<p>a little chicken when fear and doubt cloud our thoughts.</p>\n<p>All of us have doubts: “I’m not smart.” “I’m not good enough.”</p>\n<p>“So-and-so is better than me.” Our doubts often paralyze us. We</p>\n<p>play the “What if?” game. “What if the economy crashes right after</p>\n<p>I invest?” “What if I lose control and I can’t pay the money back?”</p>\n<p>“What if things don’t go as I planned?” Or we have friends or loved</p>\n<p>ones who will remind us of our shortcomings. They often say, “What</p>\n<p>makes you think you can do that?” “If it’s such a good idea, how come</p>\n<p>someone else hasn’t done it?” “That will never work. You don’t know</p>\n<p>what you’re talking about.” These words of doubt often get so loud</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>that we fail to act. A horrible feeling builds in our stomach. Sometimes</p>\n<p>we can’t sleep. We fail to move forward. So we stay with what is</p>\n<p>safe, and opportunities pass us by. We watch life passing by as we sit</p>\n<p>immobilized with a cold knot in our body. We have all felt this at one</p>\n<p>time in our lives, some more than others.</p>\n<p>Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan mutual-fund fame refers to</p>\n<p>warnings about the sky falling as “noise,” and we all hear it.</p>\n<p>Noise is either created inside our heads or comes from outside,</p>\n<p>often from friends, family, co-workers, and the media. Lynch recalls</p>\n<p>the time during the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war was so</p>\n<p>prevalent in the news that people began building fallout shelters and</p>\n<p>storing food and water. If they had invested that money wisely in</p>\n<p>the market, instead of building a fallout shelter, they’d probably be</p>\n<p>financially independent today.</p>\n<p>When violence breaks out in a city, gun sales go up all over the</p>\n<p>country. A person dies from rare hamburger meat in the state of</p>\n<p>Washington, and the Arizona Health Department orders restaurants to</p>\n<p>have all beef cooked well-done. A drug company runs a TV commercial</p>\n<p>in February showing people catching the flu. Colds go up as well as</p>\n<p>sales of cold medicine.</p>\n<p>Most people are poor because, when it comes to investing, the</p>\n<p>world is filled with Chicken Littles running around yelling, “The sky</p>\n<p>is falling! The sky is falling!” And Chicken Littles are effective, because</p>\n<p>every one of us is a little chicken. It often takes great courage to not</p>\n<p>let rumors and talk of doom and gloom affect your doubts and fears.</p>\n<p>But a savvy investor knows that the seemingly worst of times is actually</p>\n<p>the best of times to make money. When everyone else is too afraid to</p>\n<p>act, they pull the trigger and are rewarded.</p>\n<p>Some time ago, a friend named Richard came from Boston to visit</p>\n<p>Kim and me in Phoenix. He was impressed with what we had done</p>\n<p>through stocks and real estate. The Phoenix real estate prices were</p>\n<p>depressed. We spent two days showing him what we thought were</p>\n<p>excellent opportunities for cash flow and capital appreciation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>Kim and I are not real estate agents. We are strictly investors.</p>\n<p>After identifying a unit in a resort community, we called an agent who</p>\n<p>sold it to him that afternoon. The price was a mere $42,000 for a</p>\n<p>two-bedroom townhome. Similar units were going for $65,000. He</p>\n<p>had found a bargain. Excited, he bought it and returned to Boston.</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed</p>\n<p>out. I called immediately to find out why. All he said was that he</p>\n<p>talked to his neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a bad deal. He</p>\n<p>was paying too much. I asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor.</p>\n<p>Richard said he was not. When I asked why he listened to him,</p>\n<p>Richard got defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking.</p>\n<p>The real estate market in Phoenix turned, and a few years later,</p>\n<p>that little unit was renting for $1,000 a month—$2,500 in the peak</p>\n<p>winter months. The unit was worth $95,000. All Richard had to put</p>\n<p>down was $5,000 and he would have had a start at getting out of the</p>\n<p>Rat Race. Today, he still has done nothing.</p>\n<p>Richard’s backing out did not surprise me. It’s called buyer’s</p>\n<p>remorse, and it affects all of us. The little chicken won, and a chance</p>\n<p>at freedom was lost.</p>\n<p>In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in</p>\n<p>tax-lien certificates instead of CDs. I earn 16 percent per year on my</p>\n<p>money, which certainly beats the interest rates banks offer on CDs.</p>\n<p>The certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law,</p>\n<p>which is also better than most banks. The formula they’re bought on</p>\n<p>makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look at them as 2- to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone that I hold my money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>this way, especially if they have money in CDs, they will tell me it’s</p>\n<p>risky. They tell me why I should not do it. When I ask them where</p>\n<p>they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment</p>\n<p>magazine. They’ve never done it, and they’re telling someone who’s</p>\n<p>doing it why they shouldn’t. The lowest yield I look for is 16 percent,</p>\n<p>but people who are filled with doubt are willing to accept a far lower</p>\n<p>return. Doubt is expensive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>My point is that it’s those doubts and cynicism that keep most</p>\n<p>people poor and playing it safe. The real world is simply waiting for</p>\n<p>you to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor. As I said,</p>\n<p>getting out of the Rat Race is technically easy. It doesn’t take much</p>\n<p>education, but those doubts are cripplers for most people.</p>\n<p>“Cynics never win,” said rich dad. “Unchecked doubt and fear</p>\n<p>creates a cynic.” “Cynics criticize, and winners analyze” was another</p>\n<p>of his favorite sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism blinded while</p>\n<p>analysis opened eyes. Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were</p>\n<p>blind, and to see opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding</p>\n<p>what people miss is key to any success.</p>\n<p>Real estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking</p>\n<p>financial independence or freedom. It is a unique investment tool.</p>\n<p>Yet every time I mention real estate as a vehicle, I often hear, “I don’t</p>\n<p>want to fix toilets.” That’s what Peter Lynch calls noise. That’s what</p>\n<p>my rich dad would say is the cynic talking, someone who criticizes and</p>\n<p>does not analyze, someone who lets their doubts and fears close their</p>\n<p>mind instead of open their eyes.</p>\n<p>So when someone says, “I don’t want to fix toilets,” I want to fire</p>\n<p>back, “What makes you think I want to?” They’re saying a toilet is</p>\n<p>more important than what they want. I talk about freedom from the</p>\n<p>Rat Race, and they focus on toilets. That is the thought pattern that</p>\n<p>keeps most people poor. They criticize instead of analyze.</p>\n<p>“I-don’t-wants hold the key to your success,” rich dad would say.</p>\n<p>Because I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property</p>\n<p>manager who does fix toilets. And by finding a great property manager</p>\n<p>who runs houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up. But, more</p>\n<p>importantly, a great property manager allows me to buy a lot more real</p>\n<p>estate since I don’t have to fix toilets. A great property manager is key to</p>\n<p>success in real estate. Finding a good manager is more important to me</p>\n<p>than the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals</p>\n<p>before real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.</p>\n<p>That is what rich dad meant by “I-don’t-wants hold the key to</p>\n<p>your success.” Because I do not want to fix toilets either, I figured out</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>how to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out of the Rat</p>\n<p>Race. The people who continue to say “I don’t want to fix toilets” often</p>\n<p>deny themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are</p>\n<p>more important than their freedom.</p>\n<p>In the stock market, I often hear people say, “I don’t want to lose</p>\n<p>money.” Well, what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing</p>\n<p>money? They don’t make money because they choose to not lose</p>\n<p>money. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful</p>\n<p>investment vehicle, the stock market.</p>\n<p>I was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas station. He</p>\n<p>looked up and saw that the price of gas was going up and thus the</p>\n<p>price of oil. My friend is a worry wart or a Chicken Little. To him, the</p>\n<p>sky is always going to fall, and it usually does, on him.</p>\n<p>When we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the</p>\n<p>price of oil was going to go up over the next few years, statistics I had</p>\n<p>never seen before, even though I already owned substantial shares of</p>\n<p>an existing oil company. With that information, I immediately began</p>\n<p>looking for and found a new, undervalued oil company that was</p>\n<p>about to find some oil deposits. My broker was excited about this</p>\n<p>new company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per share.</p>\n<p>Three months later, this same friend and I drove by the same gas</p>\n<p>station, and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent. Again, the Chicken Little worried and complained. I</li>\n</ul>\n<p>smiled because, a month earlier, that little oil company hit oil and</p>\n<p>those 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per share since he had</p>\n<p>first given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to go up if</p>\n<p>what my friend says is true.</p>\n<p>If most people understood how a “stop” worked in stock-market</p>\n<p>investing, there would be more people investing to win instead of</p>\n<p>investing not to lose. A stop is simply a computer command that</p>\n<p>sells your stock automatically if the price begins to drop, helping to</p>\n<p>minimize your losses and maximize some gains. It’s a great tool for</p>\n<p>those who are terrified of losing.</p>\n<p>So whenever I hear people focusing on their I-don’t-wants, rather</p>\n<p>than what they do want, I know the noise in their head must be loud.</p>\n<p>Chicken Little has taken over their brain and is yelling, “The sky is</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>falling, and toilets are breaking!” So they avoid their don’t-wants, but</p>\n<p>they pay a huge price. They may never get what they want in life.</p>\n<p>Instead of analyzing, their inner Chicken Little closes their mind.</p>\n<p>Rich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. “Just do what</p>\n<p>Colonel Sanders did.” At the age of 66, he lost his business and began</p>\n<p>to live on his Social Security check. It wasn’t enough. He went around</p>\n<p>the country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down</p>\n<ul>\n<li>,009 times before someone said yes. And he went on to become a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>multimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. “He was a</p>\n<p>brave and tenacious man,” rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.</p>\n<p>So when you’re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what</p>\n<p>Colonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Laziness</h2>\n<p>Busy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a</p>\n<p>businessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a</p>\n<p>good provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the</p>\n<p>office and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home</p>\n<p>to an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and</p>\n<p>his wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship</p>\n<p>strong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work</p>\n<p>slips and he loses his job.</p>\n<p>Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their</p>\n<p>wealth. And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The</p>\n<p>cause is the same. They’re busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding</p>\n<p>something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep</p>\n<p>down they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with</p>\n<p>anger or irritation.</p>\n<p>If they aren’t busy at work or with the kids, they’re often busy</p>\n<p>watching TV, fishing, playing golf, or shopping. Yet deep down</p>\n<p>they know they are avoiding something important. That’s the most</p>\n<p>common form of laziness: laziness by staying busy.</p>\n<p>So what is the cure for laziness? The answer is—a little greed.</p>\n<p>For many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad.</p>\n<p>“Greedy people are bad people,” my mom used to say. Yet we all have</p>\n<p>inside of us this yearning to have nice, new, or exciting things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>So to keep that emotion of desire under control, often parents</p>\n<p>find ways of suppressing that desire with guilt. “You only think about</p>\n<p>yourself. Don’t you know you have brothers and sisters?” was one of</p>\n<p>my mom’s favorites. “You want me to buy you what?” was a favorite of</p>\n<p>my dad. “Do you think we’re made of money? Do you think money</p>\n<p>grows on trees? We’re not rich people, you know.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t so much the words, but the angry guilt trip that went</p>\n<p>with the words that got to me.</p>\n<p>Or the reverse guilt trip was the “I’m sacrificing my life to buy</p>\n<p>this for you. I’m buying this for you because I never had this advantage</p>\n<p>when I was a kid.” I have a neighbor who is stone-broke but can’t park</p>\n<p>his car in his garage. The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those</p>\n<p>spoiled brats get everything they ask for.</p>\n<p>“I don’t want them to know the</p>\n<h2>Rich dad believed</h2>\n<p>feeling of want” are his everyday</p>\n<h2>that the words</h2>\n<p>words. He has nothing set aside for</p>\n<p>“I can’t afford it” their college or his retirement, but</p>\n<p>shut down your brain. his kids have every toy ever made.</p>\n<p>“How can I afford it?” He recently got a new credit card in</p>\n<p>opens up possibilities, the mail and took his kids to visit Las</p>\n<p>excitement, and dreams. Vegas. “I’m doing it for the kids,” he</p>\n<p>said with great sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Rich dad forbade the words, “I can’t afford it.” In my real home,</p>\n<p>that’s all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his children to say, “How</p>\n<p>can I afford it?” He believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut</p>\n<p>down your brain. It didn’t have to think anymore. “How can I afford</p>\n<p>it?” opened up the brain and forced it to think and search for answers.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, he felt the words, “I can’t afford it,” were</p>\n<p>a lie. And the human spirit knows it. “The human spirit is very, very</p>\n<p>powerful,” he would say. “It knows it can do anything.” By having a</p>\n<p>lazy mind that says, “I can’t afford it,” a war breaks out inside you. Your</p>\n<p>spirit is angry, and your lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is</p>\n<p>screaming, “Come on. Let’s go to the gym and work out.” And the lazy</p>\n<p>mind says, “But I’m tired. I worked really hard today.” Or the human</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>spirit says, “I’m sick and tired of being poor. Let’s get out there and get</p>\n<p>rich.” To which the lazy mind says, “Rich people are greedy. Besides it’s</p>\n<p>too much bother. It’s not safe. I might lose money. I’m working hard</p>\n<p>enough as it is. I’ve got too much to do at work anyway. Look at what</p>\n<p>I have to do tonight. My boss wants it finished by morning.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t afford it” also causes sadness, a helplessness that leads</p>\n<p>to despondency and often depression. “How can I afford it?” opens</p>\n<p>up possibilities, excitement, and dreams. So rich dad was not so</p>\n<p>concerned about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that</p>\n<p>“How can I afford it?” creates a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit.</p>\n<p>Thus he rarely gave Mike or me anything. He would instead ask,</p>\n<p>“How can you afford it?” and that included college, which we paid</p>\n<p>for ourselves. It was not the goal, but the process of attaining the goal</p>\n<p>that he wanted us to learn.</p>\n<p>The problem I see today is that there are millions of people who</p>\n<p>feel guilty about their desire or their “greed.” It’s old conditioning</p>\n<p>from their childhood. While they desire to have the finer things that</p>\n<p>life offers, most have been conditioned subconsciously to say, “I can’t</p>\n<p>have that,” or “I’ll never be able to afford that.”</p>\n<p>When I decided to exit the Rat Race, it was simply a question</p>\n<p>of “How can I afford to never work again?” And my mind began to</p>\n<p>kick out answers and solutions. The hardest part was fighting my real</p>\n<p>parents’ dogma: “We can’t afford that.” “Stop thinking only about</p>\n<p>yourself.” “Why don’t you think about others?” and other similar</p>\n<p>sentiments designed to instill guilt to suppress my “greed.”</p>\n<p>So how do you beat laziness? Once again, the answer is a little</p>\n<p>greed. It’s that radio station WII-FM, which stands for “What’s In</p>\n<p>It For Me?” A person needs to sit down and ask, “What would my</p>\n<p>life be like if I never had to work again?” “What would I do if I had</p>\n<p>all the money I needed?” Without that little greed, the desire to have</p>\n<p>something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because</p>\n<p>we all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire</p>\n<p>something better. We go to school and study hard because we want</p>\n<p>something better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding something</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is,</p>\n<p>“What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.</p>\n<p>Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good.</p>\n<p>But just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street:</p>\n<p>“Greed is good.” Rich dad said it differently: “Guilt is worse than greed,</p>\n<p>for guilt robs the body of its soul.” I think Eleanor Roosevelt said it best:</p>\n<p>“Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized</p>\n<p>anyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Bad Habits</h2>\n<p>Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education. After</p>\n<p>seeing the movie Conan the Barbarian, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,</p>\n<p>a friend said, “I’d love to have a body like Schwarzenegger.” Most of the</p>\n<p>guys nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p>“I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time,” another</p>\n<p>friend added.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I heard that too,” another one said. “I heard he has a habit of</p>\n<p>working out almost every day in the gym.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I’ll bet he has to.”</p>\n<p>“Nah,” said the group cynic. “I’ll bet he was born that way. Besides,</p>\n<p>let’s stop talking about Arnold and get some beers.”</p>\n<p>This is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember</p>\n<p>asking my rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me</p>\n<p>outright, he wanted me to learn through example, as usual.</p>\n<p>“When does your dad pay his bills?” rich dad asked.</p>\n<p>“The first of the month,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Does he have anything left over?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“Very little,” I said.</p>\n<p>“That’s the main reason he struggles,” said rich dad. “He has</p>\n<p>bad habits. Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but</p>\n<p>only if he has anything left over.”</p>\n<p>“Which he usually doesn’t,” I said. “But he has to pay his bills, doesn’t</p>\n<p>he? You’re saying he shouldn’t pay his bills?”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>“Of course not,” said rich dad. “I firmly believe in paying my bills on</p>\n<p>time. I just pay myself first. Before I pay even the government.”</p>\n<p>“But what happens if you don’t have enough money?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“What do you do then?”</p>\n<p>“The same,” said rich dad. “I still pay myself first. Even if I’m</p>\n<p>short of money. My asset column is far more important to me than</p>\n<p>the government.”</p>\n<p>“But,” I said. “Don’t they come after you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, if you don’t pay,” said rich dad. “Look, I did not say not to pay.</p>\n<p>I just said I pay myself first, even if I’m short of money.”</p>\n<p>“But,” I replied. “How do you do that?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not how. The question is ‘Why?’” rich dad said.</p>\n<p>“Okay, why?”</p>\n<p>“Motivation,” said rich dad. “Who do you think will complain</p>\n<p>louder if I don’t pay them—me, or my creditors?”</p>\n<p>“Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you,” I said,</p>\n<p>responding to the obvious. “You wouldn’t say anything if you didn’t</p>\n<p>pay yourself.”</p>\n<p>“So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and</p>\n<p>the other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of</p>\n<p>income. The pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I’ve worked extra</p>\n<p>jobs, started other companies, traded in the stock market, anything just</p>\n<p>to make sure those guys don’t start yelling at me. That pressure made me</p>\n<p>work harder, forced me to think, and all in all, made me smarter and</p>\n<p>more active when it comes to money. If I had paid myself last, I would</p>\n<p>have felt no pressure, but I’d be broke.”</p>\n<p>“So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money</p>\n<p>to that motivates you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” said rich dad. “You see, government bill collectors are</p>\n<p>big bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these</p>\n<p>bullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of</p>\n<p>the 98-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?”</p>\n<p>I nodded. “I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons</p>\n<p>in the comic books all the time.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Seven: Overcoming Obstacles</p>\n<p>“Well, most people let the bullies</p>\n<h2>If I pay myself first,</h2>\n<p>kick sand in their faces. I decided to</p>\n<h2>I get financially stronger,</h2>\n<p>use the fear of the bully to make me</p>\n<h2>mentally and fiscally.</h2>\n<p>stronger. Others get weaker. Forcing</p>\n<p>myself to think about how to make</p>\n<p>extra money is like going to the gym and working out with weights. The</p>\n<p>more I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. Now I’m</p>\n<p>not afraid of those bullies.”</p>\n<p>I liked what rich dad was saying. “So if I pay myself first, I get</p>\n<p>financially stronger, mentally and fiscally.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad nodded.</p>\n<p>“And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like</p>\n<p>bosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors, and landlords push me</p>\n<p>around all my life—just because I don’t have good money habits.”</p>\n<p>Rich dad nodded. “Just like the 98-pound weakling.”</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Arrogance</h2>\n<p>“What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me</p>\n<p>money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because</p>\n<p>when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not</p>\n<p>important,” rich dad would often tell me.</p>\n<p>I have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own</p>\n<p>ignorance. It often happens when I am discussing financial statements</p>\n<p>with accountants or even other investors.</p>\n<p>They try to bluster their way through the discussion. It is clear to me</p>\n<p>that they don’t know what they’re talking about. They’re not lying, but</p>\n<p>they are not telling the truth.</p>\n<p>There are many people in the world of money, finances, and</p>\n<p>investments who have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about.</p>\n<p>Most people in the money industry are just spouting off sales pitches</p>\n<p>like used-car salesmen. When you know you are ignorant in a subject,</p>\n<p>start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on</p>\n<p>the subject.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Eight</h2>\n<h2>GETTING         STARTED</h2>\n<h2>There is gold everywhere.</h2>\n<h2>Most people are not trained to see it.</h2>\n<p>I wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but it wasn’t.</p>\n<p>So in response to the question “How do I start?” I offer the thought</p>\n<p>process I go through on a day-to-day basis. It really is easy to find</p>\n<p>great deals. I promise you that. It’s just like riding a bike. After a little</p>\n<p>wobbling, it’s a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it takes</p>\n<p>determination to get through the wobbling. That’s a personal thing.</p>\n<p>To find million-dollar “deals of a lifetime” requires us to call on our</p>\n<p>financial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us.</p>\n<p>The problem is that our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called</p>\n<p>upon. It lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that</p>\n<p>the love of money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a</p>\n<p>profession so we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have</p>\n<p>money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future</p>\n<p>because our company or the government would take care of us when</p>\n<p>our working days are over. However, it is our children, educated in the</p>\n<p>same school system, who will end up paying for this absence of financial</p>\n<p>education. The message is still to work hard, earn money, and spend it,</p>\n<p>and when we run short, we can always borrow more.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the</p>\n<p>above dogma, simply because it’s easier to find a job and work for</p>\n<p>money. If you are not one of the masses, I offer you the following</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>steps to awaken your financial genius. I simply offer you the steps</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>I have personally followed. If you want to follow some of them, great.</p>\n<p>If you don’t, make up your own. Your financial genius is smart enough</p>\n<p>to develop its own list.</p>\n<p>While in Peru, I asked a gold miner of 45 years how he was so</p>\n<p>confident about finding a gold mine. He replied, “There is gold</p>\n<p>everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it.”</p>\n<p>And I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and</p>\n<p>in a day come up with four or five great potential deals, while the</p>\n<p>average person will go out and find nothing, even looking in the same</p>\n<p>neighborhood. The reason is that they have not taken the time to</p>\n<p>develop their financial genius.</p>\n<p>I offer you the following 10 steps as a process to develop your</p>\n<p>God-given powers, powers over which only you have control.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially</p>\n<p>free, they would say yes. But then reality sets in. The road seems too</p>\n<p>long with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money</p>\n<p>and hand the excess over to your broker.</p>\n<p>I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for</p>\n<p>the U.S. Olympic team. The reality was that she had to get up every</p>\n<p>morning at four o’clock to swim for three hours before going to</p>\n<p>school. She did not party with her friends on Saturday night. She had</p>\n<p>to study and keep her grades up, just like everyone else.</p>\n<p>When I asked her what fueled her super-human ambition and</p>\n<p>sacrifice, she simply said, “I do it for myself and the people I love. It’s</p>\n<p>love that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices.”</p>\n<p>A reason or a purpose is a combination of “wants” and “don’t</p>\n<p>wants.” When people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich</p>\n<p>is, I tell them that it is a combination of deep emotional “wants” and</p>\n<p>“don’t wants.”</p>\n<p>I will list a few: first, the “don’t wants,” for they create the “wants.”</p>\n<p>I don’t want to work all my life. I don’t want what my parents aspired for,</p>\n<p>which was job security and a house in the suburbs. I don’t like being an</p>\n<p>employee. I hated that my dad always missed my football games because</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>he was so busy working on his career. I hated it when my dad worked</p>\n<p>hard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for</p>\n<p>at his death. He could not even pass on what he worked so hard for</p>\n<p>when he died. The rich don’t do that. They work hard and pass it on</p>\n<p>to their children.</p>\n<p>Now the “wants.” I want to be free to travel the world and live</p>\n<p>in the lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want</p>\n<p>to simply be free. I want control over my time and my life. I want</p>\n<p>money to work for me.</p>\n<p>Those are my deep-seated emotional reasons. What are yours?</p>\n<p>If they are not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may</p>\n<p>be greater than your reasons. I have lost money and been set back many</p>\n<p>times, but it was the deep emotional reasons that kept me standing up</p>\n<p>and going forward. I wanted to be free by age 40, but it took me until</p>\n<p>I was 47, with many learning experiences along the way.</p>\n<p>As I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn’t. But it wasn’t</p>\n<p>that hard either. I’ve learned that, without a strong reason or purpose,</p>\n<p>anything in life is hard.</p>\n<p>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE</p>\n<p>READING FURTHER. IT WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make daily choices: the power of choice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choice is the main reason people want to live in a free country.</p>\n<p>We want the power to choose.</p>\n<p>Financially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the</p>\n<p>power to choose our future: to be rich, poor, or middle class. Our</p>\n<p>spending habits reflect who we are. Poor people simply have poor</p>\n<p>spending habits. The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing</p>\n<p>Monopoly constantly. Nobody told me Monopoly was only for kids,</p>\n<p>so I just kept playing the game as an adult. I also had a rich dad who</p>\n<p>pointed out to me the difference between an asset and a liability. So</p>\n<p>a long time ago, as a little boy, I chose to be rich, and I knew that</p>\n<p>all I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real assets. My best friend,</p>\n<p>Mike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>to learn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next</p>\n<p>generation simply because there was no one trained to be a good</p>\n<p>steward over their assets.</p>\n<p>Most people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population,</p>\n<p>being rich is too much of a hassle. So they invent sayings that go: “I’m</p>\n<p>not interested in money.” “I’ll never be rich.” “I don’t have to worry.</p>\n<p>I’m still young.” “When I make some money, then I’ll think about my</p>\n<p>future.” “My husband/wife handles the finances.” The problem with</p>\n<p>those statements is that they rob the person who chooses to think such</p>\n<p>thoughts of two things: One is time, which is your most precious asset.</p>\n<p>The second is learning. Having no money should not be an excuse to</p>\n<p>not learn. But that is a choice we all make daily: the choice of what we</p>\n<p>do with our time, our money, and what we put in our heads. That is</p>\n<p>the power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and</p>\n<p>I make that choice every day.</p>\n<p>Invest first in education. In reality, the only real asset you have is your</p>\n<p>mind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Each of us has the</p>\n<p>choice of what we put in our brain once we’re old enough. You can watch</p>\n<p>TV, read golf magazines, or go to ceramics class or a class on financial</p>\n<p>planning. You choose. Most people simply buy investments rather than</p>\n<p>first investing in learning about investing.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine recently had her apartment burglarized. The</p>\n<p>thieves took her electronics and left all the books. And we all have that</p>\n<p>same choice. 90 percent of the population buys TV sets, and only about</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent buy business books.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two</p>\n<p>days long because I like to immerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was</p>\n<p>watching this guy on TV who was advertising a three-day seminar on</p>\n<p>how to buy real estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course</p>\n<p>has made me at least $2 million, if not more. But more importantly, it</p>\n<p>bought me life. I don’t have to work for the rest of my life because of</p>\n<p>that one course. I go to at least two such courses every year.</p>\n<p>I love CDs and audio books. The reason: I can easily review what</p>\n<p>I just heard. I was listening to an investor say something I completely</p>\n<p>disagreed with. Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>listened to that five-minute stretch at least 20 times, maybe more. But</p>\n<p>suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he</p>\n<p>said. It was like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of</p>\n<p>the greatest investors of our time. I gained tremendous insight into the</p>\n<p>vast resources of his education and experience.</p>\n<p>The net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I now</p>\n<p>have a new way of looking at the same problem or situation. I have two</p>\n<p>ways to analyze a problem or trend, and that is priceless. Today, I often</p>\n<p>say, “How would Donald Trump do this, or Warren Buffett or George</p>\n<p>Soros?” The only way I can access their vast mental power is to be humble</p>\n<p>enough to read or listen to what they have to say. Arrogant or critical</p>\n<p>people are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking</p>\n<p>risks. That’s because, if you learn something new, you are then required</p>\n<p>to make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.</p>\n<p>If you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems.</p>\n<p>Arrogant people rarely read or listen to experts. Why should they?</p>\n<p>They are the center of the universe.</p>\n<p>There are so many “intelligent” people who argue or defend when</p>\n<p>a new idea clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called</p>\n<p>intelligence combined with arrogance equals ignorance. Each of us</p>\n<p>knows people who are highly educated, or believe they are smart, but</p>\n<p>their balance sheet paints a different picture. A truly intelligent person</p>\n<p>welcomes new ideas, for new ideas can add to the synergy of other</p>\n<p>accumulated ideas. Listening is more important than talking. If that</p>\n<p>were not true, God would not have given us two ears and only one</p>\n<p>mouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening</p>\n<p>in order to absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of</p>\n<p>asking questions.</p>\n<p>I take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the</p>\n<p>get-rich-quick mentality most lottery players or casino gamblers have.</p>\n<p>I may go in and out of stocks, but I am long on education. If you</p>\n<p>want to fly an airplane, I advise taking lessons first. I am always</p>\n<p>shocked at people who buy stocks or real estate, but never invest in</p>\n<p>their greatest asset, their mind. Just because you bought a house or</p>\n<p>two does not make you an expert at real estate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose friends carefully: the power of association</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First of all, I do not choose my friends by their financial statements.</p>\n<p>I have friends who have actually taken a vow of poverty as well as friends</p>\n<p>who earn millions every year. The point is that I learn from all of them.</p>\n<p>Now, I will admit that there are people I have actually sought out</p>\n<p>because they had money. But I was not after their money; I was</p>\n<p>seeking their knowledge. In some cases, these people who had money</p>\n<p>have become dear friends. I’ve noticed that my friends with money</p>\n<p>talk about money. They don’t do it to brag. They’re interested in the</p>\n<p>subject. So I learn from them, and they learn from me. My friends</p>\n<p>who are in dire financial straits do not like talking about money,</p>\n<p>business, or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So</p>\n<p>I also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what</p>\n<p>not to do.</p>\n<p>I have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in</p>\n<p>their short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon:</p>\n<p>Their friends who have no money have never come to them to ask</p>\n<p>them how they did it. But they do come asking for one of two things,</p>\n<p>or both: a loan, or a job.</p>\n<p>WARNING: Don’t listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, and</p>\n<p>while I love them dearly, they are the Chicken Littles of life. To them, when it</p>\n<p>comes to money, especially investments, it’s always, “The sky is falling! The sky</p>\n<p>is falling!” They can always tell you why something won’t work. The problem</p>\n<p>is that people listen to them. But people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom</p>\n<p>information are also Chicken Littles. As that old saying goes, “Birds of a feather</p>\n<p>flock together.”</p>\n<p>If you watch business channels on TV, they often have a panel</p>\n<p>of so-called experts. One expert will say the market is going to crash,</p>\n<p>and the other will say it’s going to boom. If you’re smart, you listen</p>\n<p>to both. Keep your mind open, because both have valid points.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, most poor people listen to Chicken Little.</p>\n<p>I have had many close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an</p>\n<p>investment. Not long ago, a friend told me he was excited because he</p>\n<p>found a 6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I earn 16 percent</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>from the state government. The next day he sent me an article about</p>\n<p>why my investment was dangerous. I have received 16 percent for</p>\n<p>years now, and he still receives 6 percent.</p>\n<p>I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth-building is</p>\n<p>to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd.</p>\n<p>This is because, in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up</p>\n<p>late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late</p>\n<p>in most instances. Look for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers:</p>\n<p>“There is always another wave.” People who hurry and catch a wave</p>\n<p>late usually are the ones who wipe out.</p>\n<p>Smart investors don’t time the markets. If they miss a wave, they</p>\n<p>search for the next one and get themselves in position. This is hard</p>\n<p>for most investors because buying what is not popular is frightening.</p>\n<p>Timid investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their</p>\n<p>greed gets them in when wise investors have already taken their</p>\n<p>profits and moved on. Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not</p>\n<p>popular. They know their profits are made when they buy, not when</p>\n<p>they sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do not time the market.</p>\n<p>Just like a surfer, they get in position for the next big swell.</p>\n<p>It’s all “insider trading.” There are forms of insider trading that are</p>\n<p>illegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either</p>\n<p>way, it’s insider trading. The only distinction is: How far away from</p>\n<p>the inside are you? The reason you want to have rich friends is because</p>\n<p>that is where the money is made. It’s made on information. You want</p>\n<p>to hear about the next boom, get in, and get out before the next bust.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your</p>\n<p>chances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for.</p>\n<p>And that is financial intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of</li>\n</ul>\n<p>learning quickly</p>\n<p>In order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it’s</p>\n<p>only held in their head. The same is true for making money.</p>\n<p>Most of us have heard the saying, “You are what you eat.” I have</p>\n<p>a different slant. I say, “You become what you study.” In other words,</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>be careful what you learn, because your mind is so powerful that you</p>\n<p>become what you put in your head. For example, if you study cooking,</p>\n<p>you then tend to cook. If you don’t want to be a cook anymore, then</p>\n<p>you need to study something else.</p>\n<p>When it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic</p>\n<p>formula they learned in school and it’s this: Work for money. The</p>\n<p>predominant formula I see in the world is that every day millions of</p>\n<p>people get up, go to work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks,</p>\n<p>buy some mutual funds, and go back to work. That is the basic</p>\n<p>formula, or recipe.</p>\n<p>If you’re tired of what you’re doing, or you’re not making enough,</p>\n<p>it’s simply a case of changing the formula via which you make money.</p>\n<p>Years ago, when I was 26, I took a weekend class called “How to</p>\n<p>Buy Real Estate Foreclosures.” I learned a formula. The next trick was</p>\n<p>to have the discipline to actually put into action what I had learned.</p>\n<p>That is where most people stop. For three years, while working for</p>\n<p>Xerox, I spent my spare time learning to master the art of buying</p>\n<p>foreclosures. I’ve made several million dollars using that formula.</p>\n<p>So after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas.</p>\n<p>For many of the classes, I did not directly use the information I learned,</p>\n<p>but I always learned something new.</p>\n<p>I have attended classes designed for derivative traders, commodity</p>\n<p>option traders, and chaologists. I was way out of my league, being in a</p>\n<p>room full of people with doctorates in nuclear physics and space science.</p>\n<p>Yet, I learned a lot that made my stock and real estate investing more</p>\n<p>meaningful and lucrative.</p>\n<p>Most junior colleges and community colleges have classes on</p>\n<p>financial planning and buying traditional investments. They are good</p>\n<p>places to start, but I always search for a faster formula. That is why,</p>\n<p>on a fairly regular basis, I make more in a day than many people will</p>\n<p>make in their lifetime.</p>\n<p>Another side note: In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much</p>\n<p>what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is</p>\n<p>old. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless. It’s priceless in</p>\n<p>finding faster formulas—recipes, if you will—for making dough.</p>\n<p>Working hard for money is an old formula born in the day of cavemen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you cannot get control of yourself, do not try to get rich. It</p>\n<p>makes no sense to invest, make money, and blow it. It is the lack of</p>\n<p>self-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after</p>\n<p>winning millions. It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who</p>\n<p>get a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to say which of the 10 steps is the most important.</p>\n<p>But of all the steps, this step is probably the most difficult to master</p>\n<p>if it is not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to say that</p>\n<p>personal self-discipline is the number-one delineating factor between</p>\n<p>the rich, the poor, and the middle class.</p>\n<p>Simply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for</p>\n<p>financial pressure can never be rich. As I have said, a lesson learned from</p>\n<p>my rich dad was that the world will push you around. The world pushes</p>\n<p>people around, not because other people are bullies, but because the</p>\n<p>individual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack internal</p>\n<p>fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.</p>\n<p>In the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people</p>\n<p>to not focus on their product, service, or widget, but to focus on</p>\n<p>developing management skills. The three most important management</p>\n<p>skills necessary to start your own business are management of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cash flow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would say the skills to manage these three apply to anything, not</p>\n<p>just entrepreneurs. The three matter in the way you live your life as an</p>\n<p>individual, or as part of a family, a business, a charitable organization,</p>\n<h2>a city, or a nation.</h2>\n<p>Each of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self-discipline.</p>\n<p>I do not take the saying, “Pay yourself first,” lightly.</p>\n<p>The statement, “Pay yourself first,” comes from George Clason’s</p>\n<p>book, The Richest Man in Babylon. Millions of copies have been sold.</p>\n<p>But while millions of people freely repeat that powerful statement,</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>few follow the advice. As I said, financial literacy allows one to read</p>\n<p>numbers, and numbers tell the story. By looking at a person’s</p>\n<p>income statement and balance sheet, I can readily see if people</p>\n<p>who spout the words, “Pay yourself first,” actually practice what</p>\n<p>they preach.</p>\n<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. So let’s review the financial</p>\n<p>statements of people who pay themselves first against someone</p>\n<p>who doesn’t.</p>\n<p>Study the diagrams and see if you can pick up some distinctions.</p>\n<p>Again, it has to do with understanding cash flow, which tells the story.</p>\n<p>Most people look at the numbers and miss the story.</p>\n<p>People Who Pay Themselves First</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<p>Job</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Rent</p>\n<p>Food</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<p>Save</p>\n<p>Invest</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Do you see it? The diagram reflects the actions of individuals who</p>\n<p>choose to pay themselves first. Each month, they allocate money to</p>\n<p>their asset column before they pay their monthly expenses. Although</p>\n<p>millions of people have read Clason’s book and understand the words,</p>\n<p>“Pay yourself first,” in reality they pay themselves last.</p>\n<p>Now I can hear the howls from those of you who sincerely believe</p>\n<p>in paying your bills first. And I can hear all the responsible people who</p>\n<p>pay their bills on time. I am not saying be irresponsible and not pay your</p>\n<p>bills. All I am saying is do what the book says, which is: Pay yourself first.</p>\n<p>And the previous diagram is the correct accounting picture of that action.</p>\n<p>People Who Pay Everyone Else First</p>\n<p>INCOME STATEMENT</p>\n<p>Income</p>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<p>Job</p>\n<p>Expenses</p>\n<p>Taxes</p>\n<p>Rent</p>\n<p>Food</p>\n<p>BALANCE SHEET</p>\n<p>Assets     Liabilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>If you can truly begin to understand the power of cash flow,</p>\n<p>you will soon realize what is wrong with the previous diagram, or why</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent of people work hard all their lives and need government</li>\n</ul>\n<p>support like Social Security when they are no longer able to work.</p>\n<p>Kim and I have had many bookkeepers, accountants, and bankers</p>\n<p>who have had a major problem with this way of looking at, “Pay</p>\n<p>yourself first.” The reason is that these financial professionals actually</p>\n<p>do what the masses do: They pay themselves last.</p>\n<p>There have been times in my life when, for whatever reason, cash</p>\n<p>flow was far less than my bills. I still paid myself first. My accountant</p>\n<p>and bookkeeper screamed in panic, “They’re going to come after you.</p>\n<p>The IRS is going to put you in jail.” “You’re going to ruin your credit</p>\n<p>rating.” “They’ll cut off the electricity.” I still paid myself first.</p>\n<p>“Why?” you ask. Because that’s what the story, The Richest Man In</p>\n<p>Babylon, was all about: the power of self-discipline and the power of</p>\n<p>internal fortitude. As my rich dad taught me the first month I worked</p>\n<p>for him, most people allow the world to push them around. A bill</p>\n<p>collector calls and you “pay or else.” A sales clerk says, “Oh, just put it</p>\n<p>on your charge card.” Your real estate agent tells you, “Go ahead.</p>\n<p>The government allows you a tax deduction on your home.” That is</p>\n<p>what the book is really about—having the guts to go against the tide</p>\n<p>and get rich. You may not be weak, but when it comes to money,</p>\n<p>many people get wimpy.</p>\n<p>I am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don’t have high</p>\n<p>credit-card debt, and doodad debt, is because I pay myself first. The</p>\n<p>reason I minimize my income is because I don’t want to pay it to the</p>\n<p>government. That is why my income comes from my asset column,</p>\n<p>through a Nevada corporation. If I work for money, the government</p>\n<p>takes it.</p>\n<p>Although I pay my bills last, I am financially astute enough to not</p>\n<p>get into a tough financial situation. I don’t like consumer debt. I actually</p>\n<p>have liabilities that are higher than 99 percent of the population, but I</p>\n<p>don’t pay for them. Other people pay for my liabilities. They’re called</p>\n<p>tenants. So rule number one in paying yourself first is: Don’t get into</p>\n<p>consumer debt in the first place. Although I pay my bills last, I set it up</p>\n<p>to have only small unimportant bills that are due.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>When I occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I let</p>\n<p>the creditors and even the government scream. I like it when they get</p>\n<p>tough. Why? Because those guys do me a favor. They inspire me to go</p>\n<p>out and create more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money,</p>\n<p>and let the creditors yell. I generally pay them right away anyway. Kim</p>\n<p>and I have excellent credit. We just don’t cave in to pressure and spend</p>\n<p>our savings or liquidate stocks to pay for consumer debt. That is not</p>\n<p>too financially intelligent.</p>\n<p>To successfully pay yourself first, keep the following in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t get into large debt positions that you have to pay for. Keep</li>\n</ul>\n<p>your expenses low. Build up assets first. Then buy the big house or</p>\n<p>nice car. Being stuck in the Rat Race is not intelligent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you come up short, let the pressure build and don’t dip</li>\n</ul>\n<p>into your savings or investments. Use the pressure to inspire</p>\n<p>your financial genius to come up with new ways of making more</p>\n<p>money, and then pay your bills. You will have increased your</p>\n<p>ability to make more money as well as your financial intelligence.</p>\n<p>So many times I have gotten into financial hot water and used my</p>\n<p>brain to create more income while staunchly defending the assets in my</p>\n<p>asset column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I</p>\n<p>was like a good soldier defending the fort—Fort Assets.</p>\n<p>Poor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently</p>\n<p>called “dipping into savings.” The rich know that savings are only used to</p>\n<p>create more money, not to pay bills.</p>\n<p>I know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you’re not tough inside,</p>\n<h2>the world will always push you around anyway.</h2>\n<p>If you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works</p>\n<p>for you. A good one is to cut expenses, put your money in the bank, pay</p>\n<p>more than your fair share of income tax, buy safe mutual funds, and take</p>\n<p>the vow of the average. But this violates the pay-yourself-first rule.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>This rule does not encourage self-sacrifice or financial abstinence. It</p>\n<p>doesn’t mean pay yourself first and starve. Life was meant to be enjoyed.</p>\n<p>If you call on your financial genius, you can have all the goodies of</p>\n<p>life, get rich, and pay bills. And that is financial intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes I see people posting a sign in front of their house that</p>\n<p>says, “For Sale by Owner.” Or I see people on TV claiming to be</p>\n<p>“Discount Brokers.”</p>\n<p>My rich dad taught me to take the opposite approach. He believed</p>\n<p>in paying professionals well, and I have adopted that policy also.</p>\n<p>Today, I have expensive attorneys, accountants, real estate brokers,</p>\n<p>and stockbrokers. Why? Because if, and I do mean if, the people are</p>\n<p>professionals, their services should make you money. And the more</p>\n<p>money they make, the more money I make.</p>\n<p>We live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good</p>\n<p>broker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to</p>\n<p>educate you. I have several brokers who do that for me. Some taught</p>\n<p>me when I had little or no money, and I am still with them today.</p>\n<p>What I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of</p>\n<p>money I can make because of the information they provide. I love</p>\n<p>it when my real estate broker or stockbroker makes a lot of money</p>\n<p>because that usually means I made a lot of money.</p>\n<p>A good broker saves me time, in addition to making me money—</p>\n<p>like when I bought the vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately</p>\n<p>for over $25,000 so I could buy my Porsche quicker.</p>\n<p>A broker is my eyes and ears in the market. They’re there every day</p>\n<p>so I do not have to be. I’d rather play golf.</p>\n<p>People who sell their house on their own must not value their time</p>\n<p>much. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that</p>\n<p>time to make more money or spend it with those I love? What I find</p>\n<p>funny is that so many poor and middle-class people insist on tipping</p>\n<p>restaurant help 15 to 20 percent, even for bad service, but complain</p>\n<p>about paying a broker three to seven percent. They enjoy tipping</p>\n<p>people in the expense column and stiffing people in the asset column.</p>\n<p>That is not financially intelligent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that not all brokers are created equal. Unfortunately,</p>\n<p>most brokers are only salespeople. They sell, but they themselves own</p>\n<p>little or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker</p>\n<p>who sells houses and a broker who sells investments. The same is true for</p>\n<p>stock, bond, mutual fund, and insurance, brokers who call themselves</p>\n<p>financial planners.</p>\n<p>When I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much</p>\n<p>property or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in</p>\n<p>taxes. And that applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant.</p>\n<p>I have an accountant who minds his own business. His profession is</p>\n<p>accounting, but his business is real estate. I used to have an accountant</p>\n<p>who was a small-business accountant, but he had no real estate. I</p>\n<p>switched because we did not love the same business.</p>\n<p>Find a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will</p>\n<p>spend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find.</p>\n<p>Just be fair, and most of them will be fair to you. If all you can think</p>\n<p>about is cutting their commissions, then why should they want to help</p>\n<p>you? It’s just simple logic.</p>\n<p>As I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management</p>\n<p>of people. Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and</p>\n<p>they have power over. Many middle managers remain middle managers,</p>\n<p>failing to get promoted, because they know how to work with people</p>\n<p>below them, but not with people above them. The real skill is to manage</p>\n<p>and reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area.</p>\n<p>That is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one</p>\n<p>too. That is financial intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the first European settlers came to America, they were taken</p>\n<p>aback by a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a</p>\n<p>settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it</p>\n<p>for a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.</p>\n<p>The Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not</p>\n<p>want to give it back. That is where the term “Indian giver” came from,</p>\n<p>a simple cultural misunderstanding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>In the world of the asset column, being an Indian giver is vital to</p>\n<p>wealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is: “How fast do I</p>\n<p>get my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free,</p>\n<p>also called a “piece of the action.” That is why the ROI, or return on</p>\n<p>investment, is so important.</p>\n<p>For example, I found a small condominium that was in foreclosure</p>\n<p>a few blocks from where I lived. The bank wanted $60,000, and I</p>\n<p>submitted a bid for $50,000, which</p>\n<p>The sophisticated they took, simply because, along</p>\n<p>investor’s first with my bid, was a cashier’s check for</p>\n<p>question is:   $50,000. They realized I was serious.</p>\n<p>“How fast do I get my Most investors would say, “Aren’t you</p>\n<p>money back?”    tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be</p>\n<p>better to get a loan on it?” The answer</p>\n<p>is, “Not in this case.” My investment company uses this condominium</p>\n<p>as a vacation rental in the winter months when the “snowbirds”</p>\n<p>come to Arizona. It rents for $2,500 a month for four months out of</p>\n<p>the year. For rental during the off-season, it rents for only $1,000 a</p>\n<p>month. I had my money back in about three years. Now I own this</p>\n<p>asset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month out.</p>\n<p>The same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker calls and</p>\n<p>recommends I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a</p>\n<p>company that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value</p>\n<p>to the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money</p>\n<p>in for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then I pull my</p>\n<p>initial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of</p>\n<p>the market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on</p>\n<p>another asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own</p>\n<p>an asset that was technically free.</p>\n<p>True, I have lost money on many occasions, but I only play with</p>\n<p>money I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average 10 investments,</p>\n<p>I hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I</p>\n<p>lose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in</p>\n<p>at that time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>People who hate risk put their money in the bank. In the long run,</p>\n<p>safe savings are better than no savings. But it takes a long time to get</p>\n<p>your money back and, in most instances, you don’t get anything for</p>\n<p>free with it.</p>\n<p>On every one of my investments, there must be an upside,</p>\n<p>something for free—like a condominium, a mini-storage, a piece</p>\n<p>of free land, a house, stock shares, or an office building. And there</p>\n<p>must be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are books devoted</p>\n<p>entirely to this subject, so I will not talk about it here. Ray Kroc, of</p>\n<p>McDonald’s fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved</p>\n<p>hamburgers, but because he wanted the real estate under the franchise</p>\n<p>for free.</p>\n<p>So wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at</p>\n<p>the assets they get for free once they get their money back. That is</p>\n<p>financial intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A friend’s child has been developing a nasty habit of burning a</p>\n<p>hole in his pocket. Just 16, he wanted his own car. The excuse: “All his</p>\n<p>friends’ parents gave their kids cars.” The child wanted to go into his</p>\n<p>savings and use it for a down payment. That was when his father called</p>\n<p>me and then came to see me.</p>\n<p>“Do you think I should let him do it, or should I just buy him a car?”</p>\n<p>I answered, “It might relieve the pressure in the short term, but what</p>\n<p>have you taught him in the long term? Can you use this desire to own a</p>\n<p>car and inspire your son to learn something?” Suddenly the lights went</p>\n<p>on, and he hurried home.</p>\n<p>Two months later I ran into my friend again. “Does your son have</p>\n<p>his new car?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No, he doesn’t. But I gave him $3,000 for the car. I told him to</p>\n<p>use my money instead of his college money.”</p>\n<p>“Well, that’s generous of you,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Not really. The money came with a hitch.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>“So what was the hitch?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, first we played your CASHFLOW game. We then had</p>\n<p>a long discussion about the wise use of money. After that, I gave him</p>\n<p>a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and a few books on the</p>\n<p>stock market.”</p>\n<p>“Then what?” I asked. “What was the catch?”</p>\n<p>“I told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car</p>\n<p>with it. He could use it to find a stockbroker and buy and sell stocks.</p>\n<p>Once he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his</p>\n<p>for the car, and the $3,000 would go into his college fund.”</p>\n<p>“And what are the results?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost everything a few</p>\n<p>days later. Then he really got interested. Today, I would say he is down</p>\n<p>$2,000, but his interest is up. He has read all the books I bought him,</p>\n<p>and he’s gone to the library to get more. He reads the Wall Street Journal</p>\n<p>voraciously, watching for indicators. He’s got only $1,000 left, but his</p>\n<p>interest and learning are sky-high. He knows that if he loses that money,</p>\n<p>he walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems</p>\n<p>uninterested in getting a car, because he’s found a game that is more fun.”</p>\n<p>“What happens if he loses all the money?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. I’d rather have him lose</p>\n<p>everything now than wait till he’s our age to risk losing everything.</p>\n<p>And besides, that is the best $3,000 I’ve ever spent on his education.</p>\n<p>What he is learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained</p>\n<p>a new respect for the power of money.”</p>\n<p>As I said earlier, if a person cannot master the power of self-</p>\n<p>discipline, it is best not to try to get rich. I say this because, although</p>\n<p>the process of developing cash flow from an asset column is easy in</p>\n<p>theory, what’s hard is the mental fortitude to direct money to the</p>\n<p>correct use. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today’s</p>\n<p>consumer world to simply blow money out the expense column.</p>\n<p>With weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of</p>\n<p>least resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle.</p>\n<p>The following example illustrates the financial intelligence needed</p>\n<p>to direct money to make more money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>If we give 100 people $10,000 at the start of the year, I believe that</p>\n<p>at the end of the year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>80 would have nothing left. In fact, many would have created</li>\n</ul>\n<p>greater debt by making a down payment on a new car,</p>\n<p>refrigerator, electronics, or a holiday.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>16 would have increased that $10,000 by 5-10 percent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Four would have increased it to $20,000 or into the millions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We go to school to learn a profession so we can work for money.</p>\n<p>It is my opinion that it’s just as important to learn how to have money</p>\n<p>work for you.</p>\n<p>I love my luxuries as much as anyone else. The difference is I don’t</p>\n<p>buy them on credit. It’s the keep-up-with-the-Joneses trap. When I</p>\n<p>wanted to buy a Porsche, the easy road would have been to call my</p>\n<p>banker and get a loan. Instead of choosing to focus in the liability</p>\n<p>column, I chose to focus in the asset column.</p>\n<p>As a habit, I use my desire to consume to inspire and motivate my</p>\n<p>financial genius to invest.</p>\n<p>Too often today, we focus on borrowing money to get the things</p>\n<p>we want instead of focusing on creating money. One is easier in the</p>\n<p>short term, but harder in the long term. It’s a bad habit that we as</p>\n<p>individuals, and as a nation, have gotten into. Remember, the easy</p>\n<p>road often becomes hard, and the hard road often becomes easy.</p>\n<p>The earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters</p>\n<p>of money, the better. Money is a powerful force. Unfortunately,</p>\n<p>people use the power of money against themselves. If your financial</p>\n<p>intelligence is low, money will run all over you. It will be smarter than</p>\n<p>you. If money is smarter than you, you will work for it all your life.</p>\n<p>To be the master of money, you need to be smarter than it. Then</p>\n<p>money will do as it is told. It will obey you. Instead of being a slave to</p>\n<p>it, you will be the master of it. That is financial intelligence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose heroes: the power of myth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I was a kid, I greatly admired Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and</p>\n<p>Yogi Berra. They were my heroes, and I wanted to be just like them.</p>\n<p>I treasured their baseball cards, I knew their stats, the RBIs, the ERAs,</p>\n<p>their batting averages, how much they got paid, and how they came up</p>\n<p>from the minor leagues.</p>\n<p>As a nine-year-old kid, when I stepped up to bat or played first</p>\n<p>base or catcher, I wasn’t me. I pretended I was a famous baseball player.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the most powerful ways we learn, and we often lose that as</p>\n<p>adults. We lose our heroes.</p>\n<p>Today, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home.</p>\n<p>On the court they’re not little Johnny. They’re pretending to be</p>\n<p>their favorite basketball hero. Copying or emulating heroes is true</p>\n<p>power learning.</p>\n<p>I have new heroes as I grow older. I have golf heroes and I copy</p>\n<p>their swings and do my best to read everything I can about them. I</p>\n<p>also have heroes such as Donald Trump, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch,</p>\n<p>George Soros, and Jim Rogers. I know their stats just like I knew the</p>\n<p>ERAs and RBIs of my childhood baseball heroes. I follow what Warren</p>\n<p>Buffett invests in, and I read anything I can about his point of view</p>\n<p>on the market and how he chooses stocks. And I read about Donald</p>\n<p>Trump, trying to find out how he negotiates and puts deals together.</p>\n<p>Just as I was not me when I was up to bat, when I’m in the market</p>\n<p>or I’m negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado</p>\n<p>of Trump. Or when analyzing a trend, I look at it as though Warren</p>\n<p>Buffet were doing it. By having heroes, we tap into a tremendous</p>\n<p>source of raw genius.</p>\n<p>But heroes do more than simply inspire us. Heroes make things look</p>\n<p>easy. Making it look easy convinces us to want to be just like them.</p>\n<p>“If they can do it, so can I.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard.</p>\n<p>Instead, find heroes who make it look easy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of my dads were teachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson</p>\n<p>I have carried all my life: the necessity of being charitable or giving.</p>\n<p>My educated dad gave a lot of his time and knowledge, but almost</p>\n<p>never gave away money.</p>\n<p>He usually said that he would give when he had some extra money,</p>\n<p>but of course there was rarely any extra.</p>\n<p>My rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly</p>\n<p>in tithing. “If you want something, you first need to give,” he would</p>\n<p>always say. When he was short of money, he gave money to his church</p>\n<p>or to his favorite charity.</p>\n<p>If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever</p>\n<p>you feel short or in need of something, give what you want first and</p>\n<p>it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, or</p>\n<p>friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do,</p>\n<p>but it has always worked for me. I trust that the principle of reciprocity</p>\n<p>is true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and</p>\n<p>it comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell</p>\n<p>something, and sales come to me. I want contacts, and I help</p>\n<p>someone else get contacts. Like magic, contacts come to me. I heard</p>\n<p>a saying years ago that went: “God does not need to receive, but</p>\n<p>humans need to give.”</p>\n<p>My rich dad would often say, “Poor people are more greedy than</p>\n<p>rich people.” He would explain that if a person was rich, that person</p>\n<p>was providing something that other people wanted. In my life,</p>\n<p>whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply</p>\n<p>went out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it</p>\n<p>first. And when I gave, it always came back.</p>\n<p>It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his</p>\n<p>arms on a cold, freezing night. He is yelling at the pot-bellied stove,</p>\n<p>“When you give me some heat, then I’ll put some wood in you!” And</p>\n<p>when it comes to money, love, happiness, sales, and contacts, all one</p>\n<p>needs to remember is to give first.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Eight: Getting Started</p>\n<p>Often just the process of thinking of what I want, and how I could</p>\n<p>give that to someone else, breaks free a torrent of bounty. Whenever I feel</p>\n<p>that people aren’t smiling at me, I simply begin smiling and saying hello.</p>\n<p>Like magic, the next thing I know I’m surrounded by smiling people. It is</p>\n<p>true that your world is only a mirror of you.</p>\n<p>So that’s why I say, “Teach, and you shall receive.” I have found that</p>\n<p>the more I teach those who want to learn, the more I learn. If you want</p>\n<p>to learn about money, teach it to someone else. A torrent of new ideas</p>\n<p>and finer distinctions will come in.</p>\n<p>There are times when I have given and nothing has come back, or</p>\n<p>what I have received is not what I wanted. But upon closer inspection</p>\n<p>and soul searching, I was often giving to receive in those instances,</p>\n<p>instead of giving for the joy that giving itself brings.</p>\n<p>My dad taught teachers, and he became a master teacher. My</p>\n<p>rich dad always taught young people his way of doing business. In</p>\n<p>retrospect, it was their generosity with what they knew that made</p>\n<p>them smarter. There are powers in this world that are much smarter</p>\n<p>than we are. You can get there on your own, but it’s easier with the</p>\n<p>help of the powers that be. You only need to be generous with what</p>\n<p>you have.</p>\n<h2>Chapter Nine</h2>\n<h2>STILL    WANT       MORE?</h2>\n<h2>HERE      ARE     SOME      TO    DO\'S</h2>\n<p>Many people may not be satisfied with my 10 steps. They see them</p>\n<p>more as philosophies than actions. I think understanding the philosophy</p>\n<p>is just as important as the action. There are many people who want to do</p>\n<p>instead of think, and then there are people who think but do not do. I</p>\n<p>would say that I am both. I love new ideas, and I love action.</p>\n<p>So for those who want a to-do list on how to get started, I will</p>\n<p>share with you some of the things I do, in abbreviated form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop doing what you’re doing. In other words, take a break and</li>\n</ul>\n<p>assess what is working and what is not working. The definition</p>\n<p>of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting</p>\n<p>a different result. Stop doing what is not working, and look for</p>\n<p>something new.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and search for books on different and unique subjects. I call</p>\n<p>them formulas. I buy how-to books on formulas I know</p>\n<p>nothing about.</p>\n<p>For example, in the bookstore I found the book The 16 Percent</p>\n<p>Solution by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the book and read it</p>\n<p>and the next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Most</p>\n<p>people do not take action, or they let someone talk them out</p>\n<p>of whatever new formula they are studying. My neighbor told</p>\n<p>me why 16 percent would not work. I did not listen to him</p>\n<p>because he’s never done it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Nine: Here Are Some To Do’s</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>to lunch and ask them for tips and tricks of the trade. As for</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent tax-lien certificates, I went to the county tax office</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and found the government employee who worked in that office.</p>\n<p>I found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens. Immediately,</p>\n<p>I invited her to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything</p>\n<p>she knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all</p>\n<p>afternoon showing me everything. By the next day, I found</p>\n<p>two great properties with her help that have been accruing</p>\n<p>interest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the</p>\n<p>book, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to</p>\n<p>acquire two great deals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take classes, read, and attend seminars. I search newspapers and</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the Internet for new and interesting classes, many of which are</p>\n<p>free or inexpensive. I also attend and pay for expensive</p>\n<p>seminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from</p>\n<p>needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have</p>\n<p>friends who did not take those classes who told me I was</p>\n<p>wasting my money, and yet they’re still at the same job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make lots of offers. When I want a piece of real estate, I look</li>\n</ul>\n<p>at many properties and generally write an offer. If you don’t</p>\n<p>know what the right offer is, neither do I. That is the job of</p>\n<p>the real estate agent. They make the offers. I do as little work</p>\n<p>as possible.</p>\n<p>A friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses.</p>\n<p>So one Saturday she, her agent, and I went and looked at six</p>\n<p>apartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to write</p>\n<p>offers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the</p>\n<p>agent nearly had heart attacks. They thought it was rude, and would</p>\n<p>offend the sellers, but I really don’t think the agent wanted to work</p>\n<p>that hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better deal.</p>\n<p>No offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the right</p>\n<p>deal at the right price. Well, you don’t know what the right price is until</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>you have a second party who wants to deal. Most sellers ask too much.</p>\n<p>It is rare that a seller asks a price that is less than something is worth.</p>\n<p>Moral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no</p>\n<p>idea what it feels like to try to sell something. I have had a piece of real</p>\n<p>estate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed any offer.</p>\n<p>They could have offered me 10 pigs, and I would have been happy—</p>\n<p>not at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would have</p>\n<p>countered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that’s how the game</p>\n<p>works. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It’s fun</p>\n<p>and only a game. Make offers. Someone might say yes.</p>\n<p>I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an</p>\n<p>offer with language that details “subject-to” contingencies, such as the</p>\n<p>approval of a business partner. Never specify who the business</p>\n<p>partner is. Most people don’t know that my partner is my cat. If they</p>\n<p>accept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I call home and speak to</p>\n<p>my cat. I make this ridiculous statement to illustrate how absurdly easy</p>\n<p>and simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and</p>\n<p>take it too seriously.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>right investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go</p>\n<p>to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers,</p>\n<p>counteroffers, negotiate, reject, and accept. I know single</p>\n<p>people who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but it’s</p>\n<p>better to go to the market, even if it’s only the supermarket.</p>\n<p>Search, offer, reject, negotiate, and accept are all parts of the</p>\n<p>process of almost everything in life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have found some of my best real estate investments doing</p>\n<p>this. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year and look for</p>\n<p>change. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two</p>\n<p>elements: a bargain and change. There are lots of bargains, but</p>\n<p>it’s change that turns a bargain into a profitable opportunity.</p>\n<p>So when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in.</p>\n<p>It is the repetition that causes me to notice slight differences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chapter Nine: Here Are Some To Do’s</p>\n<p>I notice real estate signs that are up for a long time. That</p>\n<p>means the seller might be more agreeable to deal. I watch for</p>\n<p>moving trucks going in or out. I stop and talk to the drivers. I</p>\n<p>talk to the postal carriers. It’s amazing how much information</p>\n<p>they acquire about an area. I find a bad area, especially an</p>\n<p>area that the news has scared everyone away from. I drive it for</p>\n<p>sometimes a year waiting for signs of some thing changing for</p>\n<p>the better. I talk to retailers, especially new ones, and find out</p>\n<p>why they’re moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month, and</p>\n<p>I do it while doing something else, like exercising, or going to</p>\n<p>and from the store.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shop for bargains in all markets. Consumers will always be</li>\n</ul>\n<p>poor. When the supermarket has a sale, say on toilet paper, the</p>\n<p>consumer runs in and stocks up. But when the housing or stock</p>\n<p>market has a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the same</p>\n<p>consumer often runs away from it. When the supermarket raises</p>\n<p>its prices, the consumer shops somewhere else. But when housing</p>\n<p>or the stock market raise their prices, the same consumer often</p>\n<p>rushes in and starts buying. Always remember: Profits are made</p>\n<p>in the buying, not in the selling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for</li>\n</ul>\n<p>$100,000. I bought the identical condo next door for</p>\n<p>$50,000. He told me he’s waiting for the price to go up. I told</p>\n<p>him that profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. He</p>\n<p>shopped with a real estate broker who owns no property of her</p>\n<p>own. I shopped at the foreclosure auction. I paid $500 for a</p>\n<p>class on how to do this.</p>\n<p>My neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate investment</p>\n<p>class was too expensive. He said he could not afford the money,</p>\n<p>or the time. So he waits for the price to go up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for people who want to buy first. Then look for someone who</li>\n</ul>\n<p>wants to sell. A friend was looking for a certain piece of land.</p>\n<p>He had the money but did not have the time. I found a large</p>\n<p>piece of land, larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied</p>\n<p>it up with an option, called my friend, and he said he wanted</p>\n<p>a piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the</p>\n<p>land. I kept the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the</p>\n<p>story: Buy the pie, and cut it in pieces. Most people look for</p>\n<p>what they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only</p>\n<p>a piece of the pie, so they end up paying more for less. Small</p>\n<p>thinkers don’t get the big breaks. If you want to get richer,</p>\n<p>think big.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think big. Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>because most business people love big spenders. So even if</p>\n<p>you’re small, you can always think big. When my company</p>\n<p>was in the market for computers, I called several friends and</p>\n<p>asked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went to</p>\n<p>different dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted</p>\n<p>to buy so many. I have done the same with stocks. Small</p>\n<p>people remain small because they think small, act alone, or</p>\n<p>don’t act all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>exchange started out as small companies. Colonel Sanders did</p>\n<p>not get rich until after he lost everything in his 60s. Bill Gates</p>\n<p>was one of the richest men in the world before he was thirty.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Action always beats inaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few of the things I have done and continue to do</p>\n<p>to recognize opportunities. The important words are “have done” and</p>\n<p>“do.” As repeated many times throughout the book, you must take</p>\n<p>action before you can receive the financial rewards. Act now!</p>\n<h2>FINAL      THOUGHTS</h2>\n<p>I would like to share some final thoughts with you.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wrote this book, and the reason it has remained</p>\n<p>a bestseller since 2000, was to share insights into how increased financial</p>\n<p>intelligence can be used to solve many of life’s common problems. Without</p>\n<p>financial training, we all too often use the standard formulas to get through</p>\n<p>life: Work hard, save, borrow, and pay excessive taxes. Today, more than</p>\n<p>ever, we need better information.</p>\n<p>I use the following story as an example of a financial problem that</p>\n<p>confronts many young families today. How do you afford a good</p>\n<p>education for your children and provide for your own retirement?</p>\n<p>It requires using financial intelligence instead of hard work.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to</p>\n<p>save money for his four children’s college educations. He was putting</p>\n<p>$300 away in a college fund each month and had so far accumulated</p>\n<p>only about $12,000. He had about 12 more years to save for college</p>\n<p>since his oldest child was then six years old.</p>\n<p>At the time, the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. People</p>\n<p>were giving houses away. I suggested to my friend that he buy a house</p>\n<p>with some of the money in his college fund. The idea intrigued him,</p>\n<p>and we began to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that</p>\n<p>he did not have credit with the bank to buy another house since he</p>\n<p>was so over-extended. I assured him that there were other ways to</p>\n<p>finance a property rather than through the bank.</p>\n<p>We looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all our</p>\n<p>criteria. There were plenty to choose from so shopping was fun. Finally,</p>\n<p>we found a three-bedroom, two-bath home in a prime neighborhood.</p>\n<p>The owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because he</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence</p>\n<p>and his family were moving to California where another job waited.</p>\n<p>The owner wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took</p>\n<p>it immediately and agreed to carry back the loan with a 10 percent</p>\n<p>down payment. All my friend had to come up with was $7,900. As</p>\n<p>soon as the owner moved, my friend put the house up for rent. After all</p>\n<p>expenses were paid, including the mortgage, he put about $125 in his</p>\n<p>pocket each month.</p>\n<p>His plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage</p>\n<p>get paid down faster by applying the extra $125 to the principal each</p>\n<p>month. We figured that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage</p>\n<p>would be paid off and he could possibly be clearing $800 a month by</p>\n<p>the time his first child went to college. He could also sell the house if it</p>\n<p>had appreciated in value.</p>\n<p>Three years later, the real estate market greatly improved in</p>\n<p>Phoenix and he was offered $156,000 for the same house by the</p>\n<p>tenant who lived in it. Again, he asked me what I thought. I advised</p>\n<p>that he sell it, using a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another</p>\n<p>friend in Austin, Texas, who then moved this tax-deferred capital gain</p>\n<p>into a mini-storage facility. Within three months, he began receiving</p>\n<p>checks for a little less than a $1,000 a month which he then poured</p>\n<p>back into the college fund.</p>\n<p>A couple of years later, the mini-warehouse sold, and he received</p>\n<p>a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale. He rolled those</p>\n<p>funds into a new project that would now generate over $3,000 a</p>\n<p>month in income, again, going into the college fund. He is now very</p>\n<p>confident that his goal will be met easily.</p>\n<p>It only took $7,900 to start and a little financial intelligence. His</p>\n<p>children will be able to afford the education they want, and he will</p>\n<p>then use the underlying asset, wrapped in his legal entity, to pay for his</p>\n<p>retirement. As a result of this successful investment strategy, he will be</p>\n<p>able to retire early.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some</p>\n<p>insights into utilizing the power of money to work for you. Today, we</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>need greater financial intelligence to simply survive. The idea that “it takes</p>\n<p>money to make money” is the thinking of financially unsophisticated</p>\n<p>people. It does not mean that they’re not intelligent. They have simply not</p>\n<p>learned the science of money making money.</p>\n<p>Money is only an idea. If you want more money, simply change</p>\n<p>your thinking. Every self-made person started small with an idea, and</p>\n<p>then turned it into something big. The same applies to investing. It</p>\n<p>takes only a few dollars to start and grow it into something big. I meet</p>\n<p>so many people who spend their lives chasing the big deal, or trying to</p>\n<p>amass a lot of money to get into a big deal, but to me that is foolish. Too</p>\n<p>often I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large nest egg into</p>\n<p>one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good workers,</p>\n<p>but they were not good investors.</p>\n<p>Education and wisdom about money are important. Start early.</p>\n<p>Buy a book. Go to a seminar. Practice. Start small. I turned $5,000 cash</p>\n<p>into a one-million-dollar asset producing $5,000 a month cash flow in</p>\n<p>less than six years. But I started learning as a kid. I encourage you to</p>\n<p>learn, because it’s not that hard. In fact, it’s pretty easy once you get the</p>\n<p>hang of it.</p>\n<p>I think I have made my message clear. It’s what is in your head that</p>\n<p>determines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea. There is a</p>\n<p>great book called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not Work Hard</p>\n<p>and Grow Rich. Learn to have money work hard for you, and your</p>\n<p>life will be easier and happier. Today, don’t play it safe. Play it smart.</p>\n<h2>The Three Incomes</h2>\n<p>In the world of accounting, there are three different types of income:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ordinary earned</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Portfolio</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Passive</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence</p>\n<p>When my poor dad said to me, “Go to school, get good grades,</p>\n<p>and find a safe secure job,” he was recommending I work for earned</p>\n<p>income. When my rich dad said, “The rich don’t work for money.</p>\n<p>They have their money work for them,” he was talking about passive</p>\n<p>income and portfolio income. Passive income, in most cases, is income</p>\n<p>derived from real estate investments. Portfolio income is income</p>\n<p>derived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds. Portfolio income</p>\n<p>is the income that makes Bill Gates the richest man in the world, not</p>\n<p>earned income.</p>\n<p>Rich dad used to say, “The key to becoming wealthy is the</p>\n<p>ability to convert earned income into passive income or portfolio</p>\n<p>income as quickly as possible.” He would say, “Taxes are highest on</p>\n<p>earned income. The least-taxed income is passive income. That is</p>\n<p>another reason why you want your money working hard for you. The</p>\n<p>government taxes the income you work hard for more than the income</p>\n<p>your money works hard for.”</p>\n<p>In my second book, Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant, I explain</p>\n<p>the four different types of people who make up the world of business.</p>\n<p>They are E (Employee), S (Self-employed), B (Business Owner), and</p>\n<p>I (Investor). Most people go to school to learn to be an E or an S. The</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant is written about the core differences of these</p>\n<p>four types and how people can change their quadrant. In fact, most</p>\n<p>of our products are created for people in the B and I quadrants.</p>\n<p>In Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing, book number three in the Rich</p>\n<p>Dad series, I go into more detail on the importance of converting</p>\n<p>earned income into passive and portfolio income. Rich dad used to</p>\n<p>say, “All a real investor does is convert earned income into passive</p>\n<p>and portfolio income. If you know what you’re doing, investing is not</p>\n<h2>risky. It’s just common sense.”</h2>\n<h2>The Key to Financial Freedom</h2>\n<p>The key to financial freedom and great wealth is a person’s ability to</p>\n<p>convert earned income into passive and/or portfolio income. My rich dad</p>\n<p>spent a lot of time teaching Mike and me this skill. Having this ability is</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>the reason my wife Kim and I are financially free, never needing to work</p>\n<p>again. We continue to work because we choose to. Today we own a real</p>\n<p>estate investment company for passive income and participate in private</p>\n<p>placements and initial public offerings of stock for portfolio income.</p>\n<p>We also went back to work to build a financial-education company</p>\n<p>so that we can continue to create and publish books and games. All of</p>\n<p>our educational products are created to teach the same skills my rich</p>\n<p>dad taught me, the skills of converting earned income into passive and</p>\n<p>portfolio income.</p>\n<p>The games we create are important because they teach what books</p>\n<p>cannot teach. For example, you could never learn to ride a bicycle by</p>\n<p>only reading a book. Our CASHFLOW games for adults and</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW for Kids game are designed to teach players the basic</p>\n<p>investment skills of converting earned income into passive and</p>\n<p>portfolio income. They also teach the principles of accounting and</p>\n<p>financial literacy. These games are the only educational products in</p>\n<p>the world that teach people all of</p>\n<h2>You can play    these skills simultaneously.</h2>\n<h2>CASHFLOW  Classic    CASHFLOW 202 is the advanced</h2>\n<h2>on the web at    version of CASHFLOW 101 and</h2>\n<p>www.richdad.com   requires the game board from 101, as</p>\n<p>and learn to convert well as a full understanding of 101,</p>\n<p>earned income into before it can be played. CASHFLOW</p>\n<h2>passive and/or  101 and CASHFLOW for Kids</h2>\n<p>portfolio income teach the principles of fundamental</p>\n<p>investing. CASHFLOW 202 teaches the</p>\n<p>principles of technical investing. Technical investing involves advanced</p>\n<p>trading techniques such as short selling, call options, put options, and</p>\n<p>straddles. A person who understands these advanced techniques is able</p>\n<p>to make money when the market goes up, as well as when the market</p>\n<p>comes down. As my rich dad would say, “A real investor makes money</p>\n<p>in an up market and a down market. That is why they make so much</p>\n<p>money.” One of the reasons they make more money is simply because</p>\n<p>they have more self-confidence. Rich dad would say, “They have more</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Final Thoughts: Using Financial Intelligence</p>\n<p>self-confidence because they are less afraid of losing.” In other words, the</p>\n<p>average investor does not make as much money because they are so afraid</p>\n<p>of losing money. The average investor does not know how to protect</p>\n<p>themselves from losses, and that is what CASHFLOW 202 teaches.</p>\n<p>Average investors think investing is risky because they have not</p>\n<p>been formally trained to be professional investors. As Warren Buffett,</p>\n<p>America’s richest investor says, “Risk comes from not knowing what</p>\n<p>you’re doing.” My board games teach the simple basics of fundamental</p>\n<p>investing and technical investing while people are having fun.</p>\n<p>I occasionally hear someone say, “Your educational games are</p>\n<p>expensive,” which poses the question of ROI, the return on investment,</p>\n<p>or the value returned for the price paid. I nod my head and reply, “Yes,</p>\n<p>they may be expensive, especially when compared to entertainment board</p>\n<p>games. But my games are not as expensive as a college education, working</p>\n<p>hard all your life for earned income, paying excessive taxes, and then</p>\n<p>living in terror of losing all of your money in the investment markets.”</p>\n<p>When someone walks away mumbling about the price, I can hear</p>\n<p>my rich dad saying, “If you want to be rich, you must know what kind</p>\n<p>of income to work hard for, how to keep it, and how to protect it from</p>\n<p>loss. That is the key to great wealth.” Rich dad would also say, “If you</p>\n<p>do not understand the differences in those three incomes and do not</p>\n<p>learn the skills on how to acquire and protect those incomes, you will</p>\n<p>probably spend your life earning less than you could and working harder</p>\n<p>than you should.”</p>\n<p>My poor dad thought a good education, a good job, and years of</p>\n<p>hard work were all you needed to be successful. My rich dad also thought</p>\n<p>a good education was important. But to him it was also important</p>\n<p>that Mike and I know the differences in the three incomes and what</p>\n<p>kind of income to work hard for. To him, that was basic financial</p>\n<p>education. Knowing the differences in the three incomes and learning</p>\n<p>the investment skills of how to acquire the different incomes is basic</p>\n<p>education for anyone who strives to acquire great wealth and achieve</p>\n<p>financial freedom—a special kind of freedom that only a few will ever</p>\n<p>know. As rich dad states in lesson number one, “The rich do not work</p>\n<p>for money. They know how to have money work hard for them.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad</p>\n<p>Rich dad said, “Ordinary earned income is money you work for,</p>\n<p>and passive and portfolio income is money working for you.” Knowing</p>\n<p>that little difference has been significant in my life. Or, as Robert Frost</p>\n<p>ends his poem, “And that has made all the difference.”</p>\n<h2>Take Action!</h2>\n<p>All of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time.</p>\n<p>It is up to you to do what you please with both.

Kiyosaki</h2>\n<p>®</p>\n<h2>Editor’s Note</h2>\n<h2>The Times They Are A-Changin’</h2>\n<p>There have been many changes in our economy and the investing</p>\n<p>landscape since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published in 1997. Fourteen</p>\n<p>years ago, Robert Kiyosaki challenged conventional wisdom with his</p>\n<p>bold statement that “your house is not an asset.” His contrarian views on</p>\n<p>money and investing were met with skepticism, criticism, and outrage.</p>\n<p>In 2002, Robert’s book, Rich Dad’s Prophecy, advised that we prepare for</p>\n<p>an upcoming financial market crash. In 2006, Robert joined forces with</p>\n<p>Donald Trump to write Why We Want You To Be Rich, a book inspired by</p>\n<p>their concern for the shrinking middle class in America.</p>\n<p>Robert continues to be a passionate advocate for the importance and</p>\n<p>power of financial education. Today, in the wake of the subprime fiasco,</p>\n<p>record home foreclosures, and a global economic meltdown that is</p>\n<p>still raging, his words seem not only prophetic, but enlightened. Many</p>\n<p>skeptics have become believers.</p>\n<p>In preparing the 2011 edition of Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant,</p>\n<p>Robert realized two things: that his message and teachings have withstood</p>\n<p>the test of time, and that the investment landscape, the world in which</p>\n<p>investors operate, has changed dramatically. These changes have affected,</p>\n<p>and will continue to affect, those in the I (Investor) quadrant and have</p>\n<p>fueled Robert’s decision to update an important section in this book—</p>\n<p>Chapter Five: The Five Levels of Investors.</p>\n<p>ix</p>\n<h2>Contents</h2>\n<p>INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p>Which Quadrant Are You In? .................................................1</p>\n<p>Part One    The CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<p>Chapter One Why Don’t You Get a Job? ....................................................11</p>\n<p>Chapter Two Different Quadrants, Different People ..................................23</p>\n<p>Chapter Three Why People Choose Security over Freedom ..........................57</p>\n<p>Chapter Four The Three Kinds of Business Systems ....................................81</p>\n<p>Chapter Five The Five Levels of Investors ..................................................95</p>\n<p>Chapter Six You Cannot See Money with Your Eyes ..............................119</p>\n<p>Part Two    Bringing Out the Best in You</p>\n<p>Chapter Seven Becoming Who You Are .....................................................149</p>\n<p>Chapter Eight How Do I Get Rich?...........................................................165</p>\n<p>Chapter Nine Be the Bank, Not the Banker ..............................................187</p>\n<p>Part Three  How To Become a Successful B and I</p>\n<p>Chapter Ten Take Baby Steps ..................................................................217</p>\n<p>The Seven Steps to Finding Your Financial Fast Track</p>\n<p>Chapter Eleven Step 1: It’s Time to Mind Your Own Business .....................233</p>\n<p>Chapter Twelve Step 2: Take Control of Your Cash Flow .............................239</p>\n<p>Chapter Thirteen Step 3: Know the Difference Between Risk and Risky .........247</p>\n<p>Chapter Fourteen Step 4: Decide What Kind of Investor You Want to Be .......251</p>\n<p>Chapter Fifteen Step 5: Seek Mentors ..........................................................259</p>\n<p>Chapter Sixteen Step 6: Make Disappointment Your Strength… ..................269</p>\n<p>Chapter Seventeen Step 7: The Power of Faith ..................................................275</p>\n<p>Chapter Eighteen In Summary........................................................................281</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<h2>WHAT       IS  YOUR</h2>\n<h2>LIFE\'S     GOAL?</h2>\n<p>“What do you want to be when you grow up?” That is a question</p>\n<p>most of us have been asked.</p>\n<p>I had many interests as a kid, and it was easy to choose. If it</p>\n<p>sounded exciting and glamorous, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be a</p>\n<p>marine biologist, an astronaut, a Marine, a ship’s officer, a pilot, and</p>\n<p>a professional football player.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to achieve three of those goals: a Marine</p>\n<p>Corps officer, a ship’s officer, and a pilot.</p>\n<p>I knew I did not want to become a teacher, a writer, or an accountant.</p>\n<p>I did not want to be a teacher because I did not like school. I did not want</p>\n<p>to be a writer because I failed English twice. And I dropped out of my</p>\n<p>MBA program because I could not stand accounting.</p>\n<p>Ironically, now that I have grown up, I have become everything</p>\n<p>I never wanted to become. Although I disliked school, today I own an</p>\n<p>education company. I personally teach around the world because I love</p>\n<p>teaching. Although I failed English twice because I could not write,</p>\n<p>today I am best known as an author. My book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, was</p>\n<p>on the New York Times best-sellers list for over seven years and is one of</p>\n<p>the top three best-selling books in the United States. The only books</p>\n<p>ahead of it are The Joy of Sex and The Road Less Traveled. Adding one</p>\n<p>more irony, Rich Dad Poor Dad and my CASHFLOW® board game are</p>\n<p>a book and a game about accounting, another subject I struggled with.</p>\n<p>So what does this have to do with the question: “What is your goal</p>\n<p>in life?”</p>\n<p>xv</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<p>The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by</p>\n<p>a Vietnamese monk, Thich Naht Hahn: “The path is the goal.” In</p>\n<p>other words, finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is</p>\n<p>not your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your</p>\n<p>successes and failures.</p>\n<p>Finding your path means finding out what you were put here on</p>\n<p>this earth to do. What is your life’s purpose? Why were you given this</p>\n<p>gift called life? And what is the gift you give back to life?</p>\n<p>Looking back, I know going to school was not about finding my</p>\n<p>life’s path. I spent four years in military school, studying and training</p>\n<p>to be a ship’s officer. If I had made a career sailing for Standard Oil</p>\n<p>on their oil tankers, I would never have found my life’s path. If I had</p>\n<p>stayed in the Marines or had gone to fly for the airlines, I would never</p>\n<p>have found my life’s path.</p>\n<p>Had I continued on as a ship’s officer or become an airline pilot,</p>\n<p>I would never have become an international best-selling author,</p>\n<p>been a guest on the Oprah show, written a book with Donald</p>\n<p>Trump, or started an international education company that teaches</p>\n<p>entrepreneurship and investing throughout the world.</p>\n<h2>Finding Your Path</h2>\n<p>This CASHFLOW Quadrant book is important because it is about</p>\n<p>finding your path in life. As you know, most people are programmed</p>\n<p>early in life to “Go to school and get a job.” School is about finding a</p>\n<p>job in the E or S quadrant. It is not about finding your life’s path.</p>\n<p>I realize there are people who know exactly what they are going to</p>\n<p>do early in life. They grow up knowing they are going to be a doctor,</p>\n<p>lawyer, musician, golfer or actor. We have all heard about child</p>\n<p>prodigies, kids with exceptional talents. Yet you may notice, these are</p>\n<p>professions, not necessarily a life’s path.</p>\n<p>xvi</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>So How Does One Find Their Path in Life?</h2>\n<p>My answer is: I wish I knew. If I could wave my magic wand and</p>\n<p>your life’s path would magically appear, I would.</p>\n<p>Since I do not have a magic wand nor can I tell you what to do,</p>\n<p>the best thing I can do is tell you what I did. And what I did was trust</p>\n<p>my intuition, my heart, and my guts. For example, in 1973, returning</p>\n<p>from the war, when my poor dad suggested I go back to school, get my</p>\n<p>higher degrees, and work for the government, my brain went numb,</p>\n<p>my heart went heavy and my gut said, “No way.”</p>\n<p>When he suggested I get my old job back with Standard Oil or fly</p>\n<p>for the airlines, again my mind, heart, and gut said no. I knew I was</p>\n<p>through sailing and flying, although they were great professions and</p>\n<p>the pay was pretty good.</p>\n<p>In 1973 at the age of 26, I was growing up. I had followed my</p>\n<p>parent’s advice and gone to school, received my college degree, and had</p>\n<p>two professions: a license to be a ship’s officer and a license to fly. The</p>\n<p>problem was, they were professions and the dreams of a child.</p>\n<p>At the age of 26, I was old enough to know that education is a process.</p>\n<p>For example, when I wanted to be a ship’s officer, I went to a school that</p>\n<p>turned out ships’ officers. And when I wanted to learn to fly, I went to</p>\n<p>Navy flight school, a two-year process that turns non-pilots into pilots.</p>\n<p>I was cautious about my next educational process. I wanted to know what</p>\n<p>I was going to become before I started my next educational process.</p>\n<p>Traditional schools had been good to me. I had achieved my</p>\n<p>childhood professions. Reaching adulthood was confusing because</p>\n<p>there were no signs saying, “This is the way.” I knew what I didn’t want</p>\n<p>to do, but I did not know what I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>It would have been simple if all I wanted was a new profession.</p>\n<p>If I had wanted to be a medical doctor, I would have gone to medical</p>\n<p>school. If I had wanted to be a lawyer, I would have gone to law</p>\n<p>school. But I knew there was more to life than just going to school to</p>\n<p>gain another professional credential.</p>\n<p>I did not realize it at the time, but at 26 years of age, I was now</p>\n<p>looking for my path in life, not my next profession.</p>\n<p>xvii</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<h2>A Different Education</h2>\n<p>In 1973, in my last year of active duty flying for the Marine</p>\n<p>Corps when I was stationed near home in Hawaii, I knew I wanted</p>\n<p>to follow in my rich dad’s footsteps. While in the Marines, I signed</p>\n<p>up for real estate courses and business courses on the weekends,</p>\n<p>preparing to become an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.</p>\n<p>At the same time, upon a friend’s recommendation of a friend,</p>\n<p>I signed up for a personal-development course, hoping to find out</p>\n<p>who I really was. A personal-development course is non-traditional</p>\n<p>education because I was not taking it for credits or grades. I did not</p>\n<p>know what I was going to learn, as I did when I signed up for real</p>\n<p>estate courses. All I knew was that it was time to take courses to find</p>\n<p>out about me.</p>\n<p>In my first weekend course, the instructor drew this simple</p>\n<p>diagram on the flip chart:</p>\n<p>PHYSICAL</p>\n<p>MENTAL</p>\n<p>EMOTIONAL</p>\n<p>SPIRITUAL</p>\n<p>xviii</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<p>With the diagram complete, the instructor turned and said,</p>\n<p>“To develop into a whole human being, we need mental, physical,</p>\n<p>emotional, and spiritual education.”</p>\n<p>Listening to her explanation, it was clear to me that traditional schools</p>\n<p>were primarily about developing students mentally. That is why so many</p>\n<p>students who do well in school, do not do well in real life, especially in the</p>\n<p>world of money.</p>\n<p>As the course progressed over the weekend, I discovered why I disliked</p>\n<p>school. I realized that I loved learning, but hated school.</p>\n<p>Traditional education was a great environment for the “A”</p>\n<p>students, but it was not the environment for me. Traditional education</p>\n<p>was crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of</p>\n<p>fear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing, and the fear of not</p>\n<p>getting a job. They were programming me to be an employee in the E</p>\n<p>or S quadrant. I realized that traditional education is not the place for</p>\n<p>a person who wants to be an entrepreneur in the B and I quadrants.</p>\n<p>This may be why so many entrepreneurs never finish school—</p>\n<p>entrepreneurs like Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; Henry</p>\n<p>Ford, founder of Ford Motor Company; Steve Jobs, founder of Apple;</p>\n<p>Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft; Walt Disney, founder of Disneyland;</p>\n<p>and Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.</p>\n<p>As the day went on and the instructor went deeper and deeper into</p>\n<p>these four types of personal development, I realized I had spent most</p>\n<p>of my life in very harsh educational environments. After four years at</p>\n<p>an all-male military academy and five years as a Marine pilot, I was</p>\n<p>pretty strong mentally and physically. As a Marine pilot, I was strong</p>\n<p>emotionally and spiritually, but all on the macho-male development</p>\n<p>side. I had no gentle side, no female energy. After all, I was trained to</p>\n<p>be Marine Corps officer, emotionally calm under pressure, prepared to</p>\n<p>kill, and spiritually prepared to die for my country.</p>\n<p>If you ever saw the movie Top Gun starring Tom Cruise, you get</p>\n<p>a glimpse into the masculine world and bravado of military pilots. I</p>\n<p>loved that world. I was good in that world. It was a modern-day world</p>\n<p>of knights and warriors. It was not a world for wimps.</p>\n<p>xix</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<p>In the seminar, I went into my emotions and briefly touched my</p>\n<p>spirit. I cried a lot because I had a lot to cry about. I had done and</p>\n<p>seen things no one should ever be asked to do. During the seminar,</p>\n<p>I hugged a man, something I had never done before, not even with</p>\n<p>my father.</p>\n<p>On Sunday night, it was difficult leaving this self-development</p>\n<p>workshop. The seminar had been a gentle, loving, honest environment.</p>\n<p>Monday morning was a shock to once again be surrounded by young</p>\n<p>egotistical pilots, dedicated to flying, killing and dying for country.</p>\n<p>After that weekend seminar, I knew it was time to change. I knew</p>\n<p>developing myself emotionally and spiritually to become a kinder,</p>\n<p>gentler, and more compassionate person would be the hardest thing</p>\n<p>I could do. It went against all my years at the military academy and</p>\n<p>flight school.</p>\n<p>I never returned to traditional education again. I had no desire</p>\n<p>to study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From</p>\n<p>then on, if I did attend a course or school, I went to learn, to become</p>\n<p>a better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees,</p>\n<p>and credentials.</p>\n<p>Growing up in a family of teachers, your grades, the high school</p>\n<p>and college you graduated from, and your advanced degrees were</p>\n<p>everything. Like the medals and ribbons on a Marine pilot’s chest,</p>\n<p>advanced degrees and brand-name schools were the status and the</p>\n<p>stripes that educators wore on their sleeves. In their minds, people</p>\n<p>who did not finish high school were the unwashed, the lost souls of</p>\n<p>life. Those with master’s degrees looked down on those with only</p>\n<p>bachelor degrees. Those with a PhD were held in reverence. At the</p>\n<p>age of 26, I knew I would never return to that world.</p>\n<p>Editor’s Note: In 2009, Robert received an honorary PhD in</p>\n<p>entrepreneurship from prestigious San Ignacio de Loyola in</p>\n<p>Lima, Peru. The few other recipients of this award are political</p>\n<p>leaders, such as the former President of Spain.</p>\n<p>xx</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>Finding My Path</h2>\n<p>I know some of you are now asking: Why is he spending so much</p>\n<p>time talking about non-traditional education courses?</p>\n<p>The reason is, that first personal-development seminar rekindled</p>\n<p>my love of learning, but not the type of learning that is taught in</p>\n<p>school. Once that seminar was over, I became a seminar junkie, going</p>\n<p>from seminar to seminar, finding out more about the connection</p>\n<p>between my body, my mind, my emotions, and my spirit.</p>\n<p>The more I studied, the more curious about traditional education</p>\n<p>I became. I began to ask questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Why do so many kids hate school?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do so few kids like school?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why are many highly educated people not successful</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>in the real world?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Does school prepare you for the real world?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why did I hate school but love learning?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why are most schoolteachers poor?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do schools teach us little about money?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those questions led me to become a student of education outside</p>\n<p>the hallowed walls of the school system. The more I studied, the more</p>\n<p>I understood why I did not like school and why schools failed to serve</p>\n<p>most of its students, even the “A” students.</p>\n<p>My curiosity touched my spirit, and I became an entrepreneur</p>\n<p>in education. If not for this curiosity, I might never have become an</p>\n<p>author and a developer of financial-education games. My spiritual</p>\n<h2>education led me to my path in life.</h2>\n<p>It seems that our paths in life are not found in our minds. Our</p>\n<p>path in life is to find out what is in our hearts.</p>\n<p>This does not mean a person cannot find their path in traditional</p>\n<p>education. I am sure many do. I am just saying that I doubt I would</p>\n<p>have found my path in traditional school.</p>\n<p>xxi</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<h2>Why Is a Path Important?</h2>\n<p>We all know people who make a lot of money, but hate their</p>\n<p>work. We also know people who do not make a lot of money and</p>\n<p>hate their work. And we all know people who just work for money.</p>\n<p>A classmate of mine from the Merchant Marine Academy also</p>\n<p>realized he did not want to spend his life at sea. Rather than sail for</p>\n<p>the rest of his life, he went to law school after graduation, spending</p>\n<p>three more years becoming a lawyer and entering private practice in</p>\n<p>the S quadrant.</p>\n<p>He died in his early fifties. He had become a very successful,</p>\n<p>unhappy lawyer. Like me, he had two professions by the time he was</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although he hated being a lawyer, he continued being a lawyer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>because he had a family, kids, a mortgage, and bills to pay.</p>\n<p>A year before he died, I met him at a class reunion in New York.</p>\n<p>He was a bitter man. “All I do is sweep up behind rich guys like you.</p>\n<p>They pay me nothing. I hate what I do and who I work for.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you do something else?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I can’t afford to stop working. My first child is entering college.”</p>\n<p>He died of a heart attack before she graduated.</p>\n<p>He made a lot of money via his professional training, but he was</p>\n<p>emotionally angry, spiritually dead, and soon his body followed.</p>\n<p>I realize this is an extreme example. Most people do not hate what</p>\n<p>they do as much as my friend did. Yet it illustrates the problem when</p>\n<p>a person is trapped in a profession and unable to find their path.</p>\n<p>To me, this is the shortcoming of traditional education. Millions</p>\n<p>of people leave school, only to be trapped in jobs they do not like.</p>\n<p>They know something is missing in life. Many people are also trapped</p>\n<p>financially, earning just enough to survive, wanting to earn more but</p>\n<p>not knowing what to do.</p>\n<p>Without awareness of the other quadrants, many people go back</p>\n<p>to school and look for new professions or pay raises in the E or S</p>\n<p>quadrant, unaware of the world of the B and I quadrants.</p>\n<p>xxii</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>My Reason for Becoming a Teacher</h2>\n<p>My primary reason for becoming a teacher in the B quadrant was a</p>\n<p>desire to provide financial education. I wanted to make this education</p>\n<p>available to anyone who wanted to learn, regardless of how much money</p>\n<p>they had or what their grade-point averages were. That is why The Rich</p>\n<p>Dad Company started with the CASHFLOW game. This game can teach</p>\n<p>in places I could never go. The beauty of the game is that it was designed</p>\n<p>to have people teach people. There is no need for an expensive teacher</p>\n<p>or classroom. The CASHFLOW game is now translated into over sixteen</p>\n<p>languages, reaching millions of people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Today, The Rich Dad Company offers financial-education courses as</p>\n<p>well as the services of coaches and mentors to support a person’s financial</p>\n<p>education. Our programs are especially important for anyone wanting to</p>\n<p>evolve out of the E and S quadrants into the B and I quadrants.</p>\n<p>There is no guarantee that everyone will make it to the B and I</p>\n<p>quadrants, yet they will know how to access those quadrants if they want to.</p>\n<h2>Change Is Not Easy</h2>\n<p>For me, changing quadrants was not easy. It was hard work</p>\n<p>mentally, but more so emotionally and spiritually. Growing up in a</p>\n<p>family of highly educated employees in the E quadrant, I carried their</p>\n<p>values of education, job security, benefits, and a government pension.</p>\n<p>In many ways, my family values made my transition difficult. I had to</p>\n<p>shut out their warnings, concerns, and criticisms about becoming an</p>\n<p>entrepreneur and investor. Some of their values I had to discount were:</p>\n<h2>•  “What if you fail?”</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Just go back to school and get your masters degree.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Become a doctor. They make a lot of money.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“The rich are greedy.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>xxiii</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<h2>Diet and Exercise</h2>\n<p>I mention emotional and spiritual development because that is</p>\n<p>what it takes to make a permanent change in life. For example, it</p>\n<p>rarely works to tell an overweight person, “Just eat less and exercise</p>\n<p>more.” Diet and exercise may make sense mentally, but most people</p>\n<p>who are overweight do not eat because they are hungry. They eat to</p>\n<p>feed an emptiness in their emotions and their soul. When a person</p>\n<p>goes on a diet-and-exercise program, they are only working on their</p>\n<p>mind and their body. Without emotional development and spiritual</p>\n<p>strength, the overweight person may go on a diet for six months</p>\n<p>and lose a ton of weight, only to put even more weight back on later.</p>\n<p>The same is true for changing quadrants. Saying to yourself,</p>\n<p>“I’m going to become an entrepreneur in the B quadrant,” is as futile</p>\n<p>as a chain smoker saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to quit smoking.”</p>\n<p>Smoking is a physical addiction caused by emotional and spiritual</p>\n<p>challenges. Without emotional and spiritual support, the smoker</p>\n<p>will always be a smoker. The same is true for an alcoholic, a sex</p>\n<p>addict, or a chronic shopper. Most addictions are attempts to find</p>\n<p>happiness in people’s souls.</p>\n<p>This is why my company offers courses for the mind and body,</p>\n<p>but also coaches and mentors to support the emotional and spiritual</p>\n<p>transitions.</p>\n<p>A few people are able to make the journey alone, but I was not</p>\n<p>one of them. If not for a coach like my rich dad and the support</p>\n<p>of my wife Kim, I would not have made it. There were so many</p>\n<p>times I wanted to quit and give up. If not for Kim and my rich dad,</p>\n<p>I would have quit.</p>\n<p>xxiv</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>Why “A” Students Fail</h2>\n<p>Looking at the diagram again, it is easy to see why so many “A”</p>\n<p>students fail in the world of money.</p>\n<p>BODY</p>\n<p>MIND</p>\n<p>EMOTION</p>\n<p>SPIRIT</p>\n<p>A person may be highly educated mentally, but if they are not</p>\n<p>educated emotionally, their fear will often stop their body from doing</p>\n<p>what it must do. That is why so many “A” students get stuck in “analysis</p>\n<p>paralysis,” studying every little detail, but failing to do anything.</p>\n<p>This “analysis paralysis” is caused by our educational system</p>\n<p>punishing students for making mistakes. If you think about it,</p>\n<p>“A” students are “A” students simply because they made the fewest</p>\n<p>mistakes. The problem with that emotional psychosis is that, in the</p>\n<p>real world, people who take action are the ones who make the most</p>\n<p>mistakes and learn from them to win in the game of life.</p>\n<p>Just look at Presidents Clinton and Bush. Clinton could not admit</p>\n<p>he had sex and Bush could not recall any mistakes he made during his</p>\n<p>presidency. Making mistakes is human, but lying about your mistakes</p>\n<p>is criminal, a criminal act known as perjury.</p>\n<p>xxv</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<p>When criticized for making 1,014 mistakes before creating the</p>\n<p>electric light bulb, Thomas Edison said, “I did not fail 1,014 times.</p>\n<p>I successfully found out what did not work 1,014 times.”</p>\n<p>In other words, the reason so many people fail to achieve success</p>\n<p>is because they fail to fail enough times.</p>\n<p>Looking at the diagram again,</p>\n<p>BODY</p>\n<p>MIND</p>\n<p>EMOTION</p>\n<p>SPIRIT</p>\n<p>one of the reasons so many people cling to job security is because they</p>\n<p>lack emotional education. They let fear stop them.</p>\n<p>One of the best things about military school and the Marine</p>\n<p>Corps is that these organizations spend a lot of time developing</p>\n<p>young men and women spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and</p>\n<p>physically. Although it was a tough education, it was a complete</p>\n<p>education, preparing us to do a nasty job.</p>\n<p>The reason I created the CASHFLOW game is because the game</p>\n<p>educates the whole person. The game is a better teaching tool than</p>\n<p>reading or lecture, simply because the game involves the body, mind,</p>\n<p>emotions, and spirit of the player.</p>\n<p>The game is designed for players to make as many mistakes as</p>\n<p>possible with play money, and then learn from those mistakes. To me,</p>\n<p>this is a more humane way to learn about money.</p>\n<p>xxvi</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>The Path Is the Goal</h2>\n<p>Today, there are thousands of CASHFLOW clubs all over the world.</p>\n<p>One reason why CASHFLOW clubs are important is because they are</p>\n<p>a shelter from the storm, a way station on the path of life. By joining</p>\n<p>a CASHFLOW club, you get to meet people like you, people who are</p>\n<p>committed to making changes, not just talking about change.</p>\n<p>Unlike school, there is not a requirement of past academic success.</p>\n<p>All that is asked is a sincere desire to learn and make changes. In the</p>\n<p>game, you will make a lot of mistakes in different financial situations</p>\n<p>and will learn from your mistakes, using play money.</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW clubs are not for those who want to get rich quick.</p>\n<p>CASHFLOW clubs are there to support the long-term mental, emotional,</p>\n<p>spiritual, physical, and financial changes a person needs to go through. We</p>\n<p>all change and evolve at different rates of speed so you are encouraged to</p>\n<p>go at your own speed.</p>\n<p>After playing the game with others a few times, you will have a</p>\n<p>better idea of what your next step should be and which of the four asset</p>\n<p>classes (business, real estate, paper assets, or commodities) is best for you.</p>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Finding one’s path is not necessarily easy. Even today, I do not</p>\n<p>really know if I am on my path or not. As you know, we all get lost at</p>\n<p>times, and it is not always easy to find our way back.</p>\n<p>If you feel you are not in the right quadrant for you, or you are not</p>\n<p>on your life’s path, I encourage you to search your heart and find your</p>\n<p>path in life. You may know it is time to change if you are saying things</p>\n<p>like the following statements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“I’m working with dead people.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I love what I do, but I wish I could make more money.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I can’t wait for the weekend.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I want to do my own thing.”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Is it quitting time yet?”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>xxvii</p>\n<p>Preface</p>\n<p>My sister is a Buddhist nun. Her path is to support the Dalai</p>\n<p>Lama, a path that pays nothing. Yet, although she earns little, it does</p>\n<p>not mean she has to be a poor nun. She has her own rental property</p>\n<p>and investments in gold and silver. Her strength of spirit and her</p>\n<p>financially educated mind allow her to follow her life’s path without</p>\n<p>taking a vow of poverty.</p>\n<p>In many ways, it was a good thing I was labeled stupid in school.</p>\n<p>Although emotionally painful, that pain allowed me to find my life’s</p>\n<p>path as a teacher. And like my sister, the nun, just because I am a</p>\n<p>teacher does not mean I have to be a poor teacher.</p>\n<p>Repeating what Thich Naht Hahn said: “The path is the goal.”</p>\n<p>xxvii</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<h2>WHICH        QUADRANT</h2>\n<h2>ARE    YOU      IN?</h2>\n<h2>The CASHFLOW  Quadrant®</h2>\n<h2>is a way to categorize people</h2>\n<h2>based on where their money comes from.</h2>\n<p>Are you financially free?

Where we are is determined by where</p>\n<p>our cash comes from. Many of us are employees who rely on paychecks,</p>\n<p>while others are self-employed. Employees and self-employed individuals</p>\n<p>reside on the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant.

One was my real dad, and the other was my best friend’s dad.</p>\n<p>One was highly educated and the other was a high school dropout. One</p>\n<p>was poor, and the other was rich.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>Poor Dad’s Advice</h2>\n<p>Growing up, my highly educated, but poor, dad always said,</p>\n<p>“Go to school, get good grades, and find a safe secure job.” He was</p>\n<p>recommending a life path that looked like this:</p>\n<h2>SCHOOL</h2>\n<p>Poor dad recommended that I become either a well-paid E, employee,</p>\n<p>or a well-paid S, self-employed professional, such as a medical doctor,</p>\n<p>lawyer, or accountant. My poor dad was very concerned about a steady</p>\n<p>paycheck, benefits, and job security. That’s why he was a well-paid</p>\n<p>government official, the head of education for the State of Hawaii.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<h2>Rich Dad’s Advice</h2>\n<p>My uneducated, but rich, dad offered very different advice.</p>\n<p>He said, “Go to school, graduate, build businesses, and become a</p>\n<p>successful investor.” He was recommending a life path that looked</p>\n<p>like this:</p>\n<h2>SCHOOL</h2>\n<p>This book is about the mental, emotional, and educational</p>\n<p>process I went through in following my rich dad’s advice.</p>\n<h2>Who Is This Book For?</h2>\n<p>This book is written for people who are ready to change quadrants,</p>\n<p>especially for individuals who are currently in the E and S categories and</p>\n<p>are contemplating moving to the B or I category. This book is for people</p>\n<p>who are ready to move beyond job security and begin to achieve financial</p>\n<p>security. It’s not an easy life path, but the prize at the end of the road,</p>\n<p>financial freedom, is worth the journey.</p>\n<p>When I was 12 years old, rich dad told me a simple story that guided</p>\n<p>me to great wealth and financial freedom. It was his way of explaining the</p>\n<p>difference between the left side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant, the E and</p>\n<p>S quadrants, and the right side, or the B and I quadrants. The story goes</p>\n<p>like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<p>“Once upon a time there was this quaint little village. It was a great</p>\n<p>place to live except for one problem. The village had no water unless it</p>\n<p>rained. To solve this problem once and for all, the village elders asked</p>\n<p>contractors to submit bids to deliver water to the village on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Two people volunteered to take on the task, and the elders awarded the</p>\n<p>contract to both of them. They felt that a little competition would keep</p>\n<p>prices low and ensure a backup supply of water.</p>\n<p>“The first person who won the contract, Ed, immediately ran out,</p>\n<p>bought two galvanized steel buckets and began running back and forth</p>\n<p>to the lake which was a mile away. He immediately began making</p>\n<p>money as he labored morning to dusk, hauling water from the lake with</p>\n<p>his two buckets. He would empty them into the large concrete holding</p>\n<p>tank the village had built. Each morning he had to get up before the rest</p>\n<p>of the village awoke to make sure there was enough water for the people.</p>\n<p>It was hard work, but he was very happy to be making money and for</p>\n<p>having one of the two exclusive contracts for this business.</p>\n<p>“The second winning contractor, Bill, disappeared for a while.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t seen for months, which made Ed very happy, since he had</p>\n<p>no competition.</p>\n<p>“Instead of buying two buckets to compete with Ed, Bill wrote a</p>\n<p>business plan, created a corporation, found four investors, employed</p>\n<p>a president to do the work, and returned six months later with a</p>\n<p>construction crew. Within a year, his team had built a large-volume</p>\n<p>stainless-steel pipeline which connected the village to the lake.</p>\n<p>“At the grand-opening celebration, Bill announced that his</p>\n<p>water was cleaner than Ed’s water. Bill knew that the villagers had</p>\n<p>complained about the water’s lack of cleanliness. Bill also announced</p>\n<p>that he could supply the village with water 24 hours a day, 7 days a</p>\n<p>week. Ed could only deliver water on weekdays because he didn’t want</p>\n<p>to work on weekends. Then Bill announced that he would charge</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent less than Ed did for this higher-quality, more-reliable water.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The villagers cheered and immediately ran for the faucet at the end</p>\n<p>of Bill’s pipeline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>“In order to compete, Ed immediately lowered his rates by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>percent, bought two more buckets, added covers to his buckets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and began hauling four buckets each trip. In order to provide better</p>\n<p>service, he hired his two sons to give him a hand on the night shift</p>\n<p>and on weekends. When his boys went off to college, he said to them,</p>\n<p>‘Hurry back because someday this business will belong to you.’</p>\n<p>“For some reason, his two sons never returned. Eventually, Ed had</p>\n<p>employees and union problems. The union demanded higher wages</p>\n<p>and better benefits and wanted its members to only haul one bucket</p>\n<p>at a time.</p>\n<p>“Meanwhile, Bill realized that if this village needed water, then</p>\n<p>other villages must need water too. He rewrote his business plan and</p>\n<p>went off to sell his high-speed, high-volume, low-cost, clean-water</p>\n<p>delivery system to villages throughout the world. He only makes a</p>\n<p>penny per bucket of water delivered, but he delivers billions of</p>\n<p>buckets of water every day. Whether he works or not, billions of</p>\n<p>people consume billions of buckets of water, and all that money pours</p>\n<p>into his bank account. Bill developed a pipeline to deliver money to</p>\n<p>himself, as well as water to the villages.</p>\n<p>“Bill lived happily ever after. Ed worked hard for the rest of his</p>\n<p>life and had financial problems forever after. The end.”</p>\n<p>That story about Bill and Ed has guided me for years. It has</p>\n<p>assisted me in my life’s decision-making process. I often ask myself:</p>\n<p>“Am I building a pipeline or hauling buckets?”</p>\n<p>“Am I working hard, or am I working smart?”</p>\n<p>And the answers to those questions have made me financially free.</p>\n<p>That is what this book is about. It’s about what it takes to become</p>\n<p>a B and an I. It’s for people who are tired of hauling buckets and are</p>\n<p>ready to build pipelines for cash to flow into their pockets.</p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>CASHFLOW Quadrant</p>\n<h2>This Book Is Divided into Three Parts</h2>\n<p>Part One The first part of this book focuses on the core differences</p>\n<p>between people in the four quadrants. It shows why certain people</p>\n<p>gravitate to certain quadrants and often get stuck there without</p>\n<p>realizing it. It will help you identify where you are today in the</p>\n<p>quadrant and where you want to be in five years.</p>\n<p>Part Two The second part of this book is about personal change. It’s</p>\n<p>more about who you have to be, instead of what you have to do.</p>\n<p>Part Three The third part of this book explains how to find success on</p>\n<p>the right side of the CASHFLOW Quadrant. I will share more of</p>\n<p>my rich dad’s secrets on the skills required to be a successful B and I.</p>\n<p>It will help you choose your own path to financial freedom.</p>\n<p>Throughout Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant, I continue to</p>\n<p>stress the importance of financial intelligence. If you want to operate</p>\n<p>on the right side, the B- and I-quadrant side, you must be smarter</p>\n<p>than if you choose to stay on the left side, the E- and S-quadrant side. To</p>\n<p>be a B or I, you must be able to control the direction of your cash flow.</p>\n<p>This book is written for people who are ready to make changes in</p>\n<p>their lives to move beyond job security and begin to build their own</p>\n<p>pipelines to achieve financial freedom.</p>\n<p>We are in the Information Age which offers more opportunities</p>\n<p>for financial reward than ever before. Individuals with the skills of</p>\n<p>the B’s and I’s will be able to identify and seize those opportunities.</p>\n<p>To be successful in the Information Age, a person needs information</p>\n<p>from all four quadrants.

This youcan do (as others are</p>\n<p>doing so successfully) by forming a study club, consisting of any desired number</p>\n<p>of people who are friendly and harmonious.

Theprocedure shouldconsist of</p>\n<p>reading onechapter of thebook at each meeting, after which thecontents of the</p>\n<p>chapter shouldbe freely discussed by all members. Each member should make</p>\n<p>notes, putting down ALL IDEAS OF HIS OWN inspired by the discussion.

It was Mr. Carnegie\'s idea that</p>\n<p>the magic formula, which gave him a stupendous fortune, ought to be placed</p>\n<p>within reach of peoplewho do not havetime to investigate how men make</p>\n<p>money, andit was his hope that Imight test and demonstrate thesoundness of</p>\n<p>the formula through theexperience ofmen and women in every calling. He</p>\n<p>believed the formula should betaught in all public schools andcolleges, and</p>\n<p>expressed the opinion that if it were properly taught it wouldso revolutionize</p>\n<p>the entire educational system that the timespent in school couldbe reduced to</p>\n<p>less than half.</p>\n<p>His experience with Charles M.Schwab, andother young men of Mr.</p>\n<p>Schwab\'s type, convinced Mr. Carnegie that much ofthat which is taught in the</p>\n<p>schools is ofno value whatsoever in connection with the business of earning a</p>\n<p>living oraccumulating riches. Hehadarrived at this decision, because hehad</p>\n<p>taken into his business oneyoung man after another, many ofthem with but</p>\n<p>little schooling, andby coaching them in the useof this formula, developed in</p>\n<p>them rare leadership. Moreover, his coaching made fortunes for everyone of themwho</p>\n<p>followed his instructions.</p>\n<p>In thechapter on Faith, youwill read the astounding story ofthe</p>\n<p>organization of thegiantUnited States Steel Corporation, as it was conceived and</p>\n<p>carried outby oneof theyoung men through whom Mr. Carnegie provedthat</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 10</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>his formula will work forall who are ready for it.

Some</p>\n<p>havemade fortunes with it. Others haveused it successfully in creating harmony</p>\n<p>in their homes. A clergyman used it so effectively that it brought him an income</p>\n<p>of upwards of$75,000.00 a year.</p>\n<p>Arthur Nash, a Cincinnati tailor, used his near-bankrupt business as a</p>\n<p>\"guinea pig\" on which to test the formula. Thebusiness came to life and made a</p>\n<p>fortune forits owners. It is still thriving, although Mr. Nash has gone. The</p>\n<p>experiment was sounique that newspapers andmagazines, gave it morethan a</p>\n<p>million dollars\' worthof laudatory publicity.</p>\n<p>Thesecret was passedon to Stuart Austin Wier, of Dallas, Texas. He was</p>\n<p>ready forit— so ready that hegaveup his profession andstudied law. Didhe</p>\n<p>succeed? That story is toldtoo.</p>\n<p>I gave thesecret to Jennings Randolph, theday he graduated from</p>\n<p>College, and hehas used it so successfully that heis now serving his third term</p>\n<p>as a Member of Congress, with an excellent opportunity to keep on using it until</p>\n<p>it carries him to the White House.</p>\n<p>Whileserving as Advertising Manager of theLa-Salle Extension</p>\n<p>University, when it was little more than a name, Ihad theprivilege of seeing J.

Heused the information so effectively</p>\n<p>that he went directly into a responsible position at a beginning salary greater</p>\n<p>than the average man ever earns. His story has been briefly described in chapter</p>\n<p>two. When youread it, perhaps youwill dismiss any feeling youmay have had,</p>\n<p>at the beginning ofthe book, that it promised too much. And, too, if youhave</p>\n<p>ever been discouraged, if youhave had difficulties to surmount which took the</p>\n<p>very soul outof you, if youhave tried and failed, if youwere ever handicapped</p>\n<p>by illness orphysical affliction, this story ofmy son\'s discovery anduse of the</p>\n<p>Carnegie formula may proveto be the oasis in the Desert of Lost Hope,forwhich</p>\n<p>youhavebeen searching.</p>\n<p>This secret was extensively used by President Woodrow Wilson, during</p>\n<p>the World War. It was passed on to every soldier who fought in thewar,</p>\n<p>carefully wrapped in thetraining received before going to the front. President</p>\n<p>Wilson told me it was a strong factorin raising thefunds needed for thewar.</p>\n<p>More than twenty years ago, Hon. Manuel L. Quezon (then Resident</p>\n<p>Commissionerof thePhilippine Islands), was inspired by the secret to gain</p>\n<p>freedom forhis people. Hehas gained freedom forthe Philippines, andis the</p>\n<p>first President ofthe free state.</p>\n<p>A peculiar thing aboutthis secret is thatthosewho once acquire it and use</p>\n<p>it, findthemselves literally swept on to success, with but little effort,and they</p>\n<p>never again submit to failure! Ifyou doubt this, study the names of thosewho</p>\n<p>haveused it, wherever they havebeen mentioned, check their records for</p>\n<p>yourself, and be convinced.</p>\n<p>There is no such thing as SOMETHING FOR NOTHING!</p>\n<p>Thesecret to which I refer cannotbe hadwithouta price, although the</p>\n<p>price is far less than its value.

EDISON</h2>\n<p>TRULY, \"thoughts arethings,\" andpowerful things at that, when they are</p>\n<p>mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a BURNING DESIRE for</p>\n<p>their translation into riches, orother material objects.</p>\n<p>A little more than thirty years ago, Edwin C. Barnes discovered how true</p>\n<p>it is that men really do THINK AND GROW RICH. His discovery did notcome</p>\n<p>about at one sitting. It came little by little, beginning with a BURNING DESIRE</p>\n<p>to become a business associate ofthe great Edison.</p>\n<p>One ofthe chief characteristics of Barnes\' Desire was thatit was definite.</p>\n<p>He wanted to work with Edison, not for him. Observe, carefully, the description</p>\n<p>of how he went about translating his DESIRE into reality, andyouwill have a</p>\n<p>better understanding of the thirteen principles which leadto riches.</p>\n<p>When this DESIRE, orimpulse ofthought, first flashed into his mind he</p>\n<p>was in no position to act upon it. Two difficulties stood in his way. He did not</p>\n<p>know Mr. Edison, andhe didnot have enough money to pay his railroad fare to</p>\n<p>Orange, NewJersey.</p>\n<p>Thesedifficulties were sufficient to have discouraged themajority of men</p>\n<p>from making any attempt to carry outthe desire. But his was no ordinary desire!</p>\n<p>He was so determined to finda way to carry outhis desire that he finally</p>\n<p>decided to travel by \"blindbaggage,\" rather than be defeated. (To the uninitiated,</p>\n<p>this means that he went to East Orange ona freight train).</p>\n<p>He presented himself at Mr. Edison\'s laboratory, and announced hehad</p>\n<p>come to gointo business with the inventor. In speaking ofthe first meeting</p>\n<p>between Barnes andEdison, years later, Mr. Edison said, \"He stood there before</p>\n<p>me, looking like an ordinary tramp, but there was something in the expression of his</p>\n<p>face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after.</p>\n<p>I hadlearned, from years ofexperience with men, that whena man really</p>\n<p>DESIRES a thing so deeply that heis willing to stake his entire future ona single</p>\n<p>turn of thewheel in order to get it, heis sure to win.

Edison, himself, said so!It couldnot have</p>\n<p>been theyoung man\'s appearance which got him his start in theEdison office, for</p>\n<p>that was definitely against him. It was what heTHOUGHT that counted.</p>\n<p>If thesignificance of this statement could be conveyed to every person</p>\n<p>who reads it, there wouldbe no need for theremainder of this book.</p>\n<p>Barnes did notget his partnership with Edison on his first interview. He</p>\n<p>did get a chance to work in the Edison offices, at a very nominal wage, doing</p>\n<p>work that was unimportant to Edison, but most important to Barnes, because it</p>\n<p>gavehim an opportunity to display his \"merchandise\" where his intended</p>\n<p>\"partner\" couldsee it.</p>\n<p>Months went by. Apparently nothing happened to bring the coveted goal</p>\n<p>which Barnes hadset upin his mind as his DEFINITEMAJOR PURPOSE. But</p>\n<p>something important was happening in Barnes\' mind. He was constantly</p>\n<p>intensifying his DESIRE to become thebusiness associate of Edison.</p>\n<p>Psychologists havecorrectly said that \"when oneis truly ready fora thing,</p>\n<p>it puts in its appearance.\"</p>\n<p>Barnes was ready fora business association with Edison, moreover, he</p>\n<p>was DETERMINED TOREMAIN  READY  UNTIL HE GOT THAT WHICH HE</p>\n<p>WAS  SEEKING.</p>\n<p>He didnot say to himself, \"Ah well, what\'s theuse? I guess I\'ll changemy</p>\n<p>mind andtry for a salesman\'s job.\" But, hedid say, \"Icame here to go into</p>\n<p>business with Edison, and I\'ll accomplish this end if it takesthe remainder of my</p>\n<p>life.\" Hemeant it!What a different story men would haveto tell if only they</p>\n<p>wouldadopt a DEFINITEPURPOSE, andstand by that purpose until it hadtime</p>\n<p>to become an all-consuming obsession!</p>\n<p>Maybe young Barnes didnot know it at the time, but his bulldog</p>\n<p>determination, his persistence in standing back ofa single DESIRE, was destined</p>\n<p>to mow down all opposition, and bring him theopportunity hewas seeking.</p>\n<p>When the opportunity came, it appeared in a different form, andfrom a</p>\n<p>different direction than Barnes had expected. That is oneof thetricks of</p>\n<p>opportunity. It has a sly habitof slipping in by the back door, andoften it comes</p>\n<p>disguised in theform of misfortune, ortemporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so</p>\n<p>many fail to recognize opportunity.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 17</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Mr. Edison hadjust perfected a new office device, known at that time, as</p>\n<p>the Edison Dictating Machine (now theEdiphone). His salesmen were not</p>\n<p>enthusiastic over the machine. They did not believe it could besold withoutgreat</p>\n<p>effort. Barnes saw his opportunity. It hadcrawled in quietly, hidden in a queer</p>\n<p>looking machine which interested no onebut Barnes andtheinventor.</p>\n<p>Barnes knew he could sell the Edison Dictating Machine. Hesuggested</p>\n<p>this to Edison, and promptly got his chance.He didsell the machine. In fact, he</p>\n<p>sold it so successfully that Edison gavehim a contract to distribute andmarket it</p>\n<p>all overthe nation. Out ofthat business association grew theslogan, \"Made by</p>\n<p>Edison andinstalled by Barnes.\"</p>\n<p>Thebusiness alliance has been in operation for more than thirty years. Out</p>\n<p>of it Barnes has made himselfrich in money, but hehas done something</p>\n<p>infinitely greater, hehas proved that one really may \"Think andGrow Rich.\"</p>\n<p>How much actual cash that original DESIRE of Barnes\' has been worthto</p>\n<p>him, Ihave no way of knowing. Perhaps it has broughthim two orthree million</p>\n<p>dollars, but the amount, whatever it is, becomes insignificant whencompared</p>\n<p>with the greater asset heacquired in theform of definite knowledge that an</p>\n<p>intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into its physical counterpart by the</p>\n<p>application of known principles.</p>\n<p>Barnes literally thought himself into a partnership with the great Edison!</p>\n<p>He thoughthimself into a fortune. He had nothing to start with, except the</p>\n<p>capacity to KNOW WHAT HE WANTED, AND THEDETERMINATION  TO</p>\n<p>STAND  BY THAT DESIRE UNTIL HEREALIZED IT.</p>\n<p>He had no money to begin with. Hehadbut little education. Hehadno</p>\n<p>influence. But he didhaveinitiative, faith, and thewill to win. With these</p>\n<p>intangible forces he made himself number oneman with the greatest inventor</p>\n<p>who ever lived.</p>\n<p>Now, letus look at a different situation, and study a man who hadplenty</p>\n<p>of tangible evidence ofriches, but lost it, because he stopped three feet short ofthe</p>\n<p>goal he was seeking.</p>\n<h2>THREE  FEET FROM  GOLD</h2>\n<p>One ofthe most common causes of failure is the habitof quitting when</p>\n<p>oneis overtaken by temporary defeat.

The uncle operated a large farm onwhich a number ofcolored sharecrop</p>\n<p>farmers lived. Quietly, thedoorwas opened, anda small colored child, the</p>\n<p>daughter ofa tenant, walked in andtook her place nearthe door.</p>\n<p>Theuncle lookedup, saw thechild, and barked at her roughly, \"what do</p>\n<p>youwant?\"</p>\n<p>Meekly, the childreplied, \"My mammy say send her fifty cents.\"</p>\n<p>\"I\'ll not do it,\" theuncle retorted, \"Now yourunon home.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yas sah,\" thechild replied. But she did not move.</p>\n<p>Theuncle went ahead with his work, so busily engaged thathe did not</p>\n<p>pay enough attention to thechildto observe that shedid notleave.When he</p>\n<p>looked up andsaw her still standing there, heyelled at her, \"Itold you to goon</p>\n<p>home!Now go, orI\'ll take a switch to you.\"</p>\n<p>Thelittle girl said \"yas sah,\" but she did not budge an inch.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 20</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Theuncle dropped a sack of grain he was aboutto pourinto themill</p>\n<p>hopper, picked upa barrel stave, andstarted towardthe childwith an expression</p>\n<p>on his face that indicated trouble.</p>\n<p>Darby heldhis breath. He was certain hewas aboutto witness a murder.</p>\n<p>He knew his uncle hada fierce temper. Heknewthat colored children were not</p>\n<p>supposed to defy white peoplein that part of thecountry.</p>\n<p>When the uncle reached thespot where the childwas standing, she</p>\n<p>quickly stepped forward one step, looked upinto his eyes, andscreamed at the</p>\n<p>top of hershrill voice, \"MY MAMMY\'S GOTTA HAVE THAT FIFTY CENTS!\"</p>\n<p>Theuncle stopped, looked at her fora minute, then slowly laidthe barrel</p>\n<p>stave onthefloor, puthis hand in his pocket, took out half a dollar,and gave it to</p>\n<p>her.</p>\n<p>Thechildtook the money andslowly backed toward the door,never</p>\n<p>taking hereyes off theman whom she had just conquered. After shehad gone,the</p>\n<p>uncle sat down on a box andlooked outthewindow into space formorethan ten</p>\n<p>minutes. He was pondering, with awe, over the whipping he had just taken.</p>\n<p>Mr. Darby, too, was doing some thinking. That was the first time in all his</p>\n<p>experience thathehadseen a colored child deliberately masteran adult white</p>\n<p>person. How did she do it? Whathappened to his uncle thatcaused him to lose</p>\n<p>his fierceness and become as docile as a lamb?Whatstrange power did this child</p>\n<p>use thatmade her master over hersuperior? These andother similarquestions</p>\n<p>flashed into Darby\'s mind, but he didnot find theanswer until years later, when</p>\n<p>he told me thestory.</p>\n<p>Strangely, thestory ofthis unusual experience was told to theauthorin</p>\n<p>the old mill, on thevery spot where theuncle took his whipping. Strangely, too, I</p>\n<p>haddevoted nearly a quarter of a century to the study of thepower which</p>\n<p>enabled an ignorant, illiterate colored childto conquer an intelligent man.</p>\n<p>As we stoodthere in that musty oldmill, Mr. Darby repeated the story of</p>\n<p>the unusual conquest, andfinished by asking, \"Whatcan youmake ofit?

Edison\'s office,</p>\n<p>his mind was at work. Hesaw himself standing in Edison\'s presence. Heheard</p>\n<p>himselfasking Mr. Edison for an opportunity to carry outthe oneCONSUMING</p>\n<p>OBSESSION OF HIS LIFE, a BURNING DESIRE to become the business associate</p>\n<p>of thegreat inventor.</p>\n<p>Barnes\' desire was nota hope! It was not awish! It was a keen, pulsating</p>\n<p>DESIRE, which transcended everything else. It was DEFINITE.</p>\n<p>Thedesire was notnew when heapproached Edison. It had been Barnes\'</p>\n<p>dominating desire fora long time. Inthebeginning, whenthe desire first appeared</p>\n<p>in his mind, it may have been, probably was, only a wish, but it was no mere</p>\n<p>wish whenhe appeared before Edison with it.</p>\n<p>A few years later, Edwin C. Barnes again stoodbefore Edison, in thesame</p>\n<p>officewhere hefirst met the inventor. This time his DESIRE hadbeen translated</p>\n<p>into reality. He was in business with Edison. Thedominating DREAM OF HIS LIFE</p>\n<p>hadbecome a reality. Today, people who know Barnes envy him, because of the</p>\n<p>\"break\" life yielded him. They see him in the days ofhis triumph, without taking</p>\n<p>the trouble to investigate the cause of his success.</p>\n<p>Barnes succeeded because hechosea definite goal, placed all his energy,</p>\n<p>all his will power, all his effort,everything back of that goal.

Toeveryone, except himself,</p>\n<p>he appeared only another cog in the Edison business wheel, but in his own mind,</p>\n<p>HEWAS  THE PARTNER  OF EDISON EVERY MINUTE OF THE TIME, from the</p>\n<p>very day that hefirst went to work there.</p>\n<p>It is a remarkable illustration of thepower of a DEFINITE DESIRE. Barnes</p>\n<p>won his goal, because he wanted to be a business associate ofMr. Edison, more</p>\n<p>than hewanted anything else. He created a plan by which to attain that purpose.</p>\n<p>But heBURNED ALL BRIDGES BEHIND HIM.</p>\n<p>He stoodby his DESIRE until it became thedominating obsession of his</p>\n<p>life— and— finally, a fact.</p>\n<p>When he went to Orange, hedid not say to himself, \"Iwill try to induce</p>\n<p>Edison to give mea jobof some soft.\" He said, \"Iwill seeEdison, andput him on</p>\n<p>noticethat Ihavecometo gointo business with him.</p>\n<p>He didnot say, \"Iwill work there fora few months, andif Iget no</p>\n<p>encouragement, Iwill quit and get a jobsomewhere else.\" Hedidsay, \"Iwill start</p>\n<p>anywhere.

He had to win or perish!</p>\n<p>That is all there is to the Barnes story of success! A long while ago, a great</p>\n<p>warrior faced a situation which madeit necessary forhim to make a decision</p>\n<p>which insured his success onthe battlefield. He was aboutto send his armies</p>\n<p>against a powerful foe, whosemen outnumbered his own. He loaded his soldiers</p>\n<p>into boats, sailed to theenemy\'s country, unloaded soldiers andequipment, then</p>\n<p>gavethe order to burn theships thathadcarried them. Addressing his men</p>\n<p>before thefirst battle, hesaid, \"Yousee the boats going up in smoke.That means</p>\n<p>that we cannot leavethese shores aliveunless wewin!We now haveno choice—</p>\n<p>we win, or we perish! They won.</p>\n<p>Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his</p>\n<p>ships andcut all sources of retreat.

They</p>\n<p>went into a conference to decide if they would try to rebuild, orleave Chicago</p>\n<p>andstart overin a morepromising section ofthe country. They reached a</p>\n<p>decision—all except one—to leave Chicago.</p>\n<p>Themerchant who decided to stay andrebuild pointed a finger at the</p>\n<p>remains ofhis store, andsaid, \"Gentlemen, on that very spot I will build the</p>\n<p>world\'s greatest store, no matter how many times it may burn down.\"</p>\n<p>That was more than fifty years ago. Thestore was built. It stands there</p>\n<p>today, a towering monument to thepower of that stateof mind known as a</p>\n<p>BURNING  DESIRE. The easy thing forMarshal Field to have done, wouldhave</p>\n<p>been exactly what his fellow merchants did. When the going was hard, andthe</p>\n<p>future looked dismal, they pulled up and went where the going seemed easier.</p>\n<p>Mark well this difference between Marshal Fieldandthe other merchants,</p>\n<p>because it is thesame difference which distinguishes Edwin C.

It is</p>\n<p>the samedifference which distinguishes practically all who succeed from those</p>\n<p>who fail.</p>\n<p>Every human being who reaches the age of understanding ofthe purpose</p>\n<p>of money, wishes forit.

Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you</p>\n<p>desire. It is notsufficient merely to say \"Iwant plenty ofmoney.\" Be</p>\n<p>definite as to theamount. (There is a psychological reason for</p>\n<p>definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter).</p>\n<p>Second. Determine exactly what youintend to give in return</p>\n<p>forthe money youdesire. (There is no such reality as \"something</p>\n<p>fornothing.)</p>\n<p>Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess</p>\n<p>the money youdesire.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 31</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Fourth. Create a definite plan forcarrying outyourdesire,</p>\n<p>andbegin at once, whether youare ready ornot, to putthis plan</p>\n<p>intoaction.</p>\n<p>Fifth. Write outa clear, concisestatement of theamount of</p>\n<p>money youintend to acquire, namethe timelimit forits</p>\n<p>acquisition, state what youintend to give in return forthe money,</p>\n<p>anddescribe clearly the plan through which youintend to</p>\n<p>accumulate it.</p>\n<p>Sixth. Read yourwritten statement aloud,twice daily, once</p>\n<p>just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning.</p>\n<p>AS YOU READ—  SEE AND FEELAND BELIEVE YOURSELF</p>\n<p>ALREADY  IN POSSESSION OF THEMONEY.</p>\n<p>It is important thatyoufollow the instructions described in these six steps.</p>\n<p>It is especially important that youobserve, andfollow the instructions in the</p>\n<p>sixth paragraph. You may complain thatit is impossible for youto \"see yourself</p>\n<p>in possession ofmoney\" before youactually have it. Here is where a BURNING</p>\n<p>DESIRE will cometo youraid. If youtruly DESIRE money so keenly that your</p>\n<p>desire is an obsession, youwill have nodifficulty in convincing yourself thatyou</p>\n<p>will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to</p>\n<p>haveit that youCONVINCE yourself you will have it.</p>\n<p>Only those who become \"money conscious\" ever accumulate great riches.</p>\n<p>\"Money consciousness\" means that themind has become sothoroughly saturated</p>\n<p>with the DESIRE for money, thatonecan see one\'s self already in possession ofit.</p>\n<p>Tothe uninitiated, who has not been schooled in theworking principles of</p>\n<p>the human mind, these instructions may appear impractical. It may be helpful, to</p>\n<p>all who fail to recognize thesoundness of thesix steps, to know that the</p>\n<p>information they convey, was received from Andrew Carnegie, who began as an</p>\n<p>ordinary laborer in the steel mills, but managed, despite his humblebeginning,</p>\n<p>to makethese principles yieldhim a fortune ofconsiderably more than one</p>\n<p>hundred million dollars.</p>\n<p>It may beof further help to know that the six steps here recommended</p>\n<p>were carefully scrutinized by thelate Thomas A.

But the successful application ofthese six steps does call</p>\n<p>forsufficient imagination to enable oneto see, and to understand, that</p>\n<p>accumulation ofmoney cannot be left to chance, goodfortune, andluck. One</p>\n<p>must realize that all who haveaccumulated great fortunes, first did a certain</p>\n<p>amount of dreaming, hoping, wishing, DESIRING, andPLANNING before they</p>\n<p>acquired money.</p>\n<p>Youmay as well know, right here, that youcan never have richesin great</p>\n<p>quantities, UNLESS youcan work yourself into a whiteheat ofDESIRE for</p>\n<p>money, andactually BELIEVE youwill possess it.</p>\n<p>Youmay as well know, also that every great leader, from thedawn of</p>\n<p>civilization down to thepresent, was a dreamer.

Ifirst saw him twenty-four years ago, a few</p>\n<p>minutes after hewas born. He cameinto theworldwithoutany physical sign of</p>\n<p>ears, andthe doctor admitted, whenpressed foran opinion, that thechildmight</p>\n<p>be deaf, andmute forlife.</p>\n<p>I challenged thedoctor\'s opinion. Ihadthe right to do so, Iwas the child\'s</p>\n<p>father. I, too, reached a decision, andrendered an opinion, but I expressed the</p>\n<p>opinion silently, in thesecrecy of my own heart. Idecided thatmy son would</p>\n<p>hear andspeak. Nature could send me a childwithoutears, but Nature could not</p>\n<p>induce me to accept the reality of theaffliction.</p>\n<p>In my own mind Iknew that my son wouldhear andspeak. How? I was</p>\n<p>sure there must be a way, andIknew Iwouldfindit. I thoughtof thewordsof</p>\n<p>the immortal Emerson, \"The wholecourse ofthings goesto teach us faith. We</p>\n<p>need only obey.</p>\n<p>There is guidance for each of us, andby lowly listening, we shall hear the</p>\n<p>right word.\"</p>\n<p>Therightword? DESIRE! More than anything else, IDESIRED thatmy</p>\n<p>son shouldnot be a deaf mute. From that desire Inever receded, not fora second.</p>\n<p>Many years previously, Ihad written, \"Ouronly limitations are thosewe</p>\n<p>set upin ourown minds.\" Forthefirst time, Iwondered if thatstatement were</p>\n<p>true. Lying on thebed in front of me was a newly born child, withoutthe natural</p>\n<p>equipment of hearing. Even though he might hear andspeak, hewas obviously</p>\n<p>disfigured for life. Surely, this was a limitation which that childhadnot setup in</p>\n<p>his own mind.</p>\n<p>What could Ido aboutit? Somehow Iwould find a way to transplant into</p>\n<p>that child\'s mind my own BURNING DESIRE forways and means ofconveying</p>\n<p>sound to his brain without theaid ofears.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 38</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>As soon as thechild was oldenough to cooperate, Iwouldfill his mind so</p>\n<p>completely with a BURNING DESIRE to hear, that Nature would,by methods of</p>\n<p>her own, translate it into physical reality.</p>\n<p>All this thinking took place in my own mind, but Ispoke ofit to noone.</p>\n<p>Every day I renewed thepledge I hadmade to myself, not to accept a deaf mute</p>\n<p>fora son.</p>\n<p>As he grew older, andbegan to take notice of things around him, we</p>\n<p>observed that hehada slight degree of hearing. When hereached theage when</p>\n<p>children usually begin talking, hemade no attempt to speak, but we couldtell by</p>\n<p>his actions that hecouldhear certain sounds slightly. That was all Iwanted to</p>\n<p>know! Iwas convinced that if he couldhear, even slightly, hemight develop still</p>\n<p>greater hearing capacity. Then something happened which gavemehope.It</p>\n<p>came from an entirely unexpected source.</p>\n<p>We bought a victrola. When thechild heard themusic forthe first time, he</p>\n<p>went into ecstasies, andpromptly appropriated the machine. Hesoon showed a</p>\n<p>preference forcertain records, among them, \"It\'s a Long Way to Tipperary.\" On</p>\n<p>oneoccasion, he played that piece over andover, foralmost two hours, standing</p>\n<p>in front ofthe victrola, with his teeth clamped on the edge ofthe case. Thesignificance</p>\n<p>of this self-formed habit ofhis didnot become clear to us until years afterward,</p>\n<p>forwe hadnever heard of theprinciple of \"boneconduction\" ofsound at that</p>\n<p>time.</p>\n<p>Shortly after heappropriated the victrola, Idiscovered that hecouldhear</p>\n<p>me quite clearly when Ispoke with my lips touching his mastoid bone, orat the</p>\n<p>base of thebrain. These discoveries placed in my possession thenecessary media</p>\n<p>by which I began to translate into reality my Burning Desire to help my son</p>\n<p>develop hearing andspeech. By that timehe was making stabsat speaking</p>\n<p>certain words. Theoutlook was farfrom encouraging, but DESIRE BACKED BY</p>\n<p>FAITH knows nosuch word as impossible.</p>\n<p>Having determined that hecould hearthe sound of my voice plainly, I</p>\n<p>began, immediately, to transfer to his mind thedesire to hear andspeak. Isoon</p>\n<p>discovered that thechild enjoyed bedtime stories, soI went to work, creating</p>\n<p>stories designed to develop in him self-reliance, imagination, and a keen desire to</p>\n<p>hear and to benormal.</p>\n<p>There was one story in particular, which Iemphasized by giving it some</p>\n<p>new anddramatic coloring each timeit was told. It was designed to plant in his</p>\n<p>mind the thought that his affliction was nota liability, but an asset of greatvalue.</p>\n<p>Despite the factthat all the philosophy Ihad examined clearly indicated that</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 39</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>EVERY ADVERSITY BRINGS WITH IT THE SEED OF AN EQUIVALENT</p>\n<p>ADVANTAGE,  Imust confess that Ihadnottheslightest idea how this affliction</p>\n<p>could ever become an asset. However, Icontinued my practice of wrapping that</p>\n<p>philosophy in bedtime stories, hoping the timewould come whenhewouldfind</p>\n<p>some plan by which his handicap couldbe made to serve someuseful purpose.</p>\n<p>Reason toldme plainly, that there was no adequate compensation forthe lack of</p>\n<p>ears andnatural hearing equipment. DESIRE backed by FAITH, pushed reason</p>\n<p>aside, andinspired meto carry on.</p>\n<p>As I analyze theexperience in retrospect, Ican see now, that my son\'s faith</p>\n<p>in me hadmuch to do with the astounding results. He didnotquestion anything I</p>\n<p>toldhim. Isold him theidea that hehada distinct advantage over his older</p>\n<p>brother, and that this advantagewouldreflect itself in many ways. Forexample,</p>\n<p>the teachers in school would observe thathe had no ears, and,because ofthis,</p>\n<p>they would show him special attention andtreat him with extraordinary</p>\n<p>kindness. They always did. His mother saw to that, by visiting theteachers and</p>\n<p>arranging with them to givethe childthe extra attention necessary. Isold him the</p>\n<p>idea, too, thatwhen hebecame oldenough to sell newspapers, (his older brother</p>\n<p>hadalready become a newspaper merchant), hewouldhave a big advantage</p>\n<p>over his brother, forthe reason thatpeople would pay him extra money forhis</p>\n<p>wares, because they could seethat hewas a bright, industrious boy, despite the</p>\n<p>fact hehadno ears.</p>\n<p>We couldnoticethat, gradually, thechild\'s hearing was improving.</p>\n<p>Moreover, he hadnot the slightest tendency to be self-conscious, because ofhis</p>\n<p>affliction. When hewas about seven, he showed thefirst evidence that our</p>\n<p>method ofservicing his mind was bearing fruit.Forseveral months he begged</p>\n<p>forthe privilege of selling newspapers, but his mother wouldnot give her</p>\n<p>consent. She was afraid that his deafness madeit unsafeforhim to go on the</p>\n<p>street alone.</p>\n<p>Finally, he took matters in his own hands. One afternoon, whenhe was</p>\n<p>left at home with theservants, heclimbed through the kitchen window, shinnied</p>\n<p>to theground, and setouton his own. Heborrowed six cents in capital from the</p>\n<p>neighborhood shoemaker, invested it in papers, sold out,reinvested, andkept</p>\n<p>repeating until latein the evening. After balancing his accounts, andpaying back</p>\n<p>the six cents hehad borrowed from his banker, hehad a netprofit of forty-two</p>\n<p>cents. When we got home thatnight, we foundhim in bed asleep, with the</p>\n<p>money tightly clenched in his hand.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 40</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>His mother opened his hand, removed thecoins, and cried.

The transaction pleased me, because I knew that hehadgivenevidence</p>\n<p>of a trait of resourcefulness that wouldgo with him all through life. Later events</p>\n<p>proved this to be true. When his older brother wanted something, hewouldlie</p>\n<p>down onthe floor,kick his feet in the air,cry for it— and get it. When the \"little</p>\n<p>deaf boy\" wanted something, he would plan a way to earn the money, then buy</p>\n<p>it forhimself. He still follows thatplan!</p>\n<p>Truly, my own son has taught me thathandicaps can be converted into</p>\n<p>stepping stones on which onemay climbtoward some worthy goal, unless they</p>\n<p>are accepted as obstacles, and used as alibis.</p>\n<p>Thelittle deaf boy went through thegrades, high school, andcollege</p>\n<p>withoutbeing able to hear his teachers, excepting whenthey shouted loudly, at</p>\n<p>closerange.

Here Isaw a demonstration which gaveme a greatly</p>\n<p>enlarged visionof what Ihad done to arouse andkeep alivein my son\'s mind the</p>\n<p>DESIRE fornormal hearing. I saw deaf mutes actually being taught to hearand</p>\n<p>to speak, through application ofthe self-sameprinciple I hadused, morethan</p>\n<p>twenty years previously, in saving my son from deaf mutism.</p>\n<p>Thus, through somestrange turn ofthe Wheel of Fate,my son, Blair, andI</p>\n<p>havebeen destined to aid in correcting deaf mutism for thoseas yet unborn,</p>\n<p>because we are theonly living human beings, as far as Iknow, who have</p>\n<p>established definitely the factthat deaf mutism can be corrected to the extent of</p>\n<p>restoring to normal life thosewho suffer with this affliction. Ithas been donefor</p>\n<p>one; it will be doneforothers.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt in my mind thatBlair wouldhavebeen a deaf mute all</p>\n<p>his life, if his mother andI had not managed to shape his mind as we did. The</p>\n<p>doctorwho attended at his birth told us, confidentially, the childmight never</p>\n<p>hear orspeak. A few weeks ago, Dr. Irving Voorhees, a noted specialist onsuch</p>\n<p>cases, examined Blair very thoroughly. He was astounded whenhe learned how</p>\n<p>well my son now hears, and speaks, andsaidhis examination indicated that</p>\n<p>\"theoretically, theboy should not be able to hear at all.\" But theladdoeshear,</p>\n<p>despite thefact thatX-ray pictures show there is no opening in theskull,</p>\n<p>whatsoever, from where his ears shouldbe to thebrain.</p>\n<p>When I planted in his mindthe DESIRE to hear andtalk, andliveas a</p>\n<p>normal person, there went with thatimpulse some strange influence which</p>\n<p>caused Nature to become bridge-builder, and span thegulf of silence between his</p>\n<p>brain andthe outer world, by some means which thekeenest medical specialists</p>\n<p>havenot been able to interpret.

It would be unforgivable if Ineglected to</p>\n<p>tell theworld as much as Iknow of thehumble part Iassumed in thestrange</p>\n<p>experience.

These qualities are</p>\n<p>free to everyone.</p>\n<p>In all my experience in dealing with men andwomen who hadpersonal</p>\n<p>problems, Inever handled a single case which more definitely demonstrates the</p>\n<p>power ofDESIRE.

Ithas been my</p>\n<p>goodfortune to have hadthe privilege oftesting the soundness ofthe POWER</p>\n<p>OF DESIRE, through the affliction of my own son.

It consisted of three very definite facts; first,</p>\n<p>I MIXED FAITH with theDESIRE fornormal hearing, which Ipassed on to my</p>\n<p>son.

Faith is a state ofmind</p>\n<p>which youmay develop at will, after youhavemastered thethirteen principles,</p>\n<p>because it is a state ofmind which develops voluntarily, through application and</p>\n<p>use of these principles.</p>\n<p>Repetition of affirmation oforders to your subconscious mind is the only known</p>\n<p>method ofvoluntary development ofthe emotion offaith.</p>\n<p>Perhaps themeaning may be made clearer through thefollowing</p>\n<p>explanation as to theway men sometimes become criminals. Stated in the words</p>\n<p>of a famous criminologist, \"When men first come into contact with crime, they</p>\n<p>abhorit. If they remain in contact with crime for a time,they become accustomed</p>\n<p>to it, andendure it. If they remain in contactwith it long enough, they finally</p>\n<p>embrace it, and become influenced by it.\"</p>\n<p>This is the equivalent ofsaying that any impulse ofthoughtwhich is</p>\n<p>repeatedly passed on to the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted andacted</p>\n<p>upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulseinto its</p>\n<p>physical equivalent, by the most practical procedure available.</p>\n<p>In connection with this, consider again thestatement, ALL THOUGHTS</p>\n<p>WHICH  HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALIZED, (given feeling) AND MIXED WITH</p>\n<p>FAITH, begin immediately to translate themselves into their physical equivalent</p>\n<p>orcounterpart.</p>\n<p>Theemotions, orthe \"feeling\" portion ofthoughts, arethe factorswhich</p>\n<p>givethoughts vitality, life, andaction.

There is</p>\n<p>nothing to hinder youfrom \"deceiving\" your subconscious mind whengiving it</p>\n<p>instructions through autosuggestion, as I deceived my son\'s subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>Tomakethis \"deceit\" more realistic, conduct yourself just as youwould, if</p>\n<p>youwere ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF THE MATERIAL THING WHICH</p>\n<p>YOU  ARE DEMANDING, when youcall upon your subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>Thesubconscious mind will transmute into its physical equivalent, by the</p>\n<p>most direct andpractical media available, any order which is given to it in a state</p>\n<p>of BELIEF, orFAITH that the order will be carried out.</p>\n<p>Surely, enough has been stated to give a starting point from which one</p>\n<p>may, through experiment and practice, acquire the ability to mix FAITH with</p>\n<p>any order given to thesubconscious mind. Perfection will comethrough practice.</p>\n<p>It cannot come by merely readinginstructions.</p>\n<p>If it be true thatonemay become a criminal by association with crime,</p>\n<p>(and this is a known fact), it is equally true that onemay develop faith by</p>\n<p>voluntarily suggesting to the subconscious mind that one has faith.

And still later, when the</p>\n<p>Government brought suit to dissolvethe Steel Trust, he gave his own version,</p>\n<p>from the witness stand, of the remarks thatstimulated Morgan into a frenzy of</p>\n<p>financial activity.</p>\n<p>\"It is probable, however, that it was a \'homely\' speech, somewhat</p>\n<p>ungrammatical (for theniceties of language never bothered Schwab), full of</p>\n<p>epigram andthreaded with wit. But aside from thatit hada galvanic force and</p>\n<p>effect upon thefivebillions ofestimated capital that was represented by the</p>\n<p>diners. After it was over andthegathering was still under its spell, although</p>\n<p>Schwab hadtalked for ninety minutes, Morgan led theoratorto a recessed</p>\n<p>window where, dangling their legs from the high, uncomfortable seat, they</p>\n<p>talked for an hour more.</p>\n<p>\"The magic of theSchwab personality hadbeen turned on, full force, but</p>\n<p>what was more important andlasting was the full-fledged, clear-cut program he</p>\n<p>laiddown forthe aggrandizement ofSteel. Many other men hadtried to interest</p>\n<p>Morgan in slapping together a steel trust after the pattern of thebiscuit, wire and</p>\n<p>hoop, sugar, rubber, whisky, oil orchewing gum combinations. John W. Gates,</p>\n<p>the gambler, hadurged it, but Morgan distrusted him. The Moore boys, Bill and</p>\n<p>Jim, Chicago stock jobbers who had glued together a match trust and a cracker</p>\n<p>corporation, hadurged it and failed.Elbert H. Gary, thesanctimonious country</p>\n<p>lawyer, wanted to foster it, but hewasn\'t big enough to be impressive. Until</p>\n<p>Schwab\'s eloquence took J. P. Morgan to the heights fromwhich he could</p>\n<p>visualize thesolid results ofthe most daring financial undertaking ever</p>\n<p>conceived, the project was regarded as a delirious dream ofeasy-money</p>\n<p>crackpots.</p>\n<p>\"The financial magnetism thatbegan, a generation ago, to attract</p>\n<p>thousands of small andsometimes inefficiently managed companies into large</p>\n<p>andcompetition-crushing combinations, had become operative in thesteel world</p>\n<p>through the devices ofthat jovial business pirate, John W. Gates. Gates already</p>\n<p>hadformed the American Steel andWire Company outof a chain of small</p>\n<p>concerns, andtogether with Morgan hadcreated the Federal Steel Company. The</p>\n<p>National Tube andAmerican Bridge companies were two more Morgan</p>\n<p>concerns, andtheMoore Brothers hadforsaken thematch and cookiebusiness to</p>\n<p>form the \'American\' group— Tin Plate, Steel Hoop, Sheet Steel— and the</p>\n<p>National Steel Company.</p>\n<p>\"But by theside ofAndrew Carnegie\'s gigantic vertical trust, a trust</p>\n<p>owned and operated by fifty-three partners, those other combinations were</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 59</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>picayune. They might combine to their heart\'s content but thewholelotofthem</p>\n<p>couldn\'t make a dent in the Carnegie organization, andMorgan knew it.</p>\n<p>\"The eccentric oldScot knew it, too. From the magnificent heights of Skibo</p>\n<p>Castle hehadviewed, first with amusement andthen with resentment, the</p>\n<p>attempts of Morgan\'s smaller companies to cutinto his business. When the</p>\n<p>attempts became too bold, Carnegie\'s temper was translated into anger and</p>\n<p>retaliation. Hedecided to duplicate every mill owned by his rivals. Hitherto, he</p>\n<p>hadn\'t been interested in wire, pipe, hoops, orsheet. Instead, hewas content to</p>\n<p>sell such companies theraw steel and letthem work it into whatever shape they</p>\n<p>wanted. Now, with Schwabas his chief andable lieutenant, he planned to drive</p>\n<p>his enemies to thewall.</p>\n<p>\"So it was thatin the speech ofCharles M. Schwab, Morgan saw the</p>\n<p>answer to his problem of combination. A trust withoutCarnegie—giant ofthem</p>\n<p>all—wouldbe no trust at all, a plum pudding, as onewriter said, without the</p>\n<p>plums.</p>\n<p>\"Schwab\'s speech on thenight ofDecember 12, 1900, undoubtedly carried</p>\n<p>the inference, though not the pledge, that the vast Carnegie enterprise couldbe</p>\n<p>brought under the Morgan tent. He talked of theworld future forsteel, of</p>\n<p>reorganization forefficiency, of specialization, of thescrapping ofunsuccessful</p>\n<p>mills andconcentration of efforton theflourishing properties, ofeconomies in</p>\n<p>the oretraffic, ofeconomies in overhead andadministrative departments, of</p>\n<p>capturing foreign markets.</p>\n<p>\"More than that, hetoldthebuccaneers among them wherein lay the</p>\n<p>errors of their customary piracy. Their purposes, he inferred, badbeen to create</p>\n<p>monopolies, raise prices, and pay themselves fat dividends out ofprivilege.</p>\n<p>Schwab condemned thesystem in his heartiest manner. Theshortsightedness of</p>\n<p>such a policy, hetoldhis hearers, lay in thefact that it restricted the market in an</p>\n<p>era when everything cried forexpansion. By cheapening the cost ofsteel, he</p>\n<p>argued, an ever-expanding market would be created; more uses for steel would</p>\n<p>be devised, and a goodly portion ofthe world trade could be captured. Actually,</p>\n<p>though he did not know it, Schwab was an apostle ofmodern mass production.</p>\n<p>\"So the dinner at theUniversity Club cameto an end.Morgan went home,</p>\n<p>to think about Schwab\'s rosy predictions.

Mr. Carnegie, Schwab indicated, might not like it if hefoundhis</p>\n<p>trusted company president hadbeen flirting with the Emperor of Wall Street, the</p>\n<p>Street upon which Carnegie was resolved never to tread. Then it was suggested</p>\n<p>by John W. Gates thego-between, that if Schwab \'happened\' to be in theBellevue</p>\n<p>Hotelin Philadelphia, J. P. Morgan might also \'happen\' to be there. When</p>\n<p>Schwab arrived, however, Morgan was inconveniently ill at his NewYork home,</p>\n<p>andso, onthe elder man\'s pressing invitation, Schwab went to NewYork and</p>\n<p>presented himself at thedoor of the financier\'s library.</p>\n<p>\"Now certain economic historians have professed the belief thatfrom the</p>\n<p>beginning to theend of the drama, thestagewas set by Andrew Carnegie— that</p>\n<p>the dinner to Schwab, thefamous speech, the Sunday night conference between</p>\n<p>Schwab andthe Money King, were events arranged by thecanny Scot. The truth</p>\n<p>is exactly theopposite. When Schwab was called in to consummate the deal, he</p>\n<p>didn\'t even know whether \'the little boss, \' as Andrew was called, would so</p>\n<p>much as listen to an offer to sell, particularly to a groupof men whom Andrew</p>\n<p>regarded as being endowed with something less than holiness. But Schwab did</p>\n<p>take into the conference with him, in his own handwriting, six sheets of copper-</p>\n<p>plate figures, representing to his mind thephysical worth andthe potential</p>\n<p>earning capacity of every steel company heregarded as an essential star in the</p>\n<p>new metal firmament.</p>\n<p>\"Four men pondered over these figures all night. The chief, of course, was</p>\n<p>Morgan, steadfast in his belief in the Divine Right ofMoney. With him was his</p>\n<p>aristocratic partner, Robert Bacon, a scholar and a gentleman. Thethird was John</p>\n<p>W. Gates whom Morgan scorned as a gambler andused as a tool. Thefourth was</p>\n<p>Schwab, who knew more aboutthe processes ofmaking andselling steel than</p>\n<p>any whole group ofmen then living. Throughoutthatconference, the</p>\n<p>Pittsburgher\'s figures were never questioned. If he said a company was worth so</p>\n<p>much, then it was worth thatmuch and no more. He was insistent, too, upon</p>\n<p>including in the combination only those concerns henominated. He had</p>\n<p>conceived a corporation in which there wouldbe noduplication, noteven to</p>\n<p>satisfy thegreed offriends who wanted to unload their companies upon the</p>\n<p>broad Morgan shoulders.

Stated</p>\n<p>in another way, auto-suggestion is self-suggestion. It is the agency of</p>\n<p>communication between that part ofthe mind where conscious thought takes</p>\n<p>place, andthat which serves as the seat of action forthe subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>Through the dominating thoughts which one permitsto remain in the</p>\n<p>conscious mind, (whether these thoughts be negative orpositive, is immaterial),</p>\n<p>the principle ofauto-suggestion voluntarily reaches thesubconscious mind and</p>\n<p>influences it with these thoughts.</p>\n<p>NOTHOUGHT,   whether it be negativeorpositive, CAN ENTER THE</p>\n<p>SUBCONSCIOUS  MIND WITHOUT  THEAID OF THEPRINCIPLE OF AUTO-</p>\n<p>SUGGESTION, with the exception of thoughts picked up from theether. Stated</p>\n<p>differently, all sense impressions which areperceived through thefivesenses, are</p>\n<p>stopped by the CONSCIOUS thinking mind, andmay be either passed onto the</p>\n<p>subconscious mind, orrejected, at will. The conscious faculty serves, therefore, as</p>\n<p>an outer-guard to theapproach of thesubconscious.</p>\n<p>Nature has sobuilt man that hehas ABSOLUTE CONTROL overthe</p>\n<p>material which reaches his subconscious mind, through his fivesenses, although</p>\n<p>this is notmeant to be construed as a statement that man always EXERCISES this</p>\n<p>control.

When</p>\n<p>youbegin to carry outthefirst ofthe six steps, which instructs youto \"fix in your</p>\n<p>own mind theEXACT amount of money youdesire,\" hold yourthoughts onthat</p>\n<p>amount of money by CONCENTRATION, orfixation ofattention, with your</p>\n<p>eyes closed, until youcan ACTUALLY SEE thephysical appearance ofthe</p>\n<p>money.

Following the preceding</p>\n<p>statement, consider thepossibility ofplaying a perfectly legitimate \"trick\" on</p>\n<p>yoursubconscious mind, by making it believe, because you believe it, thatyou</p>\n<p>must have theamount ofmoney you arevisualizing, that this money is already</p>\n<p>awaiting your claim, that the subconscious mind MUST hand over to you</p>\n<p>practical plans foracquiring themoney which is yours.</p>\n<p>Handover thethought suggested in the preceding paragraph to your</p>\n<p>IMAGINATION, and see what your imagination can, orwill do, to create</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 68</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>practical plans forthe accumulation ofmoney through transmutation ofyour</p>\n<p>desire.</p>\n<p>DONOT  WAIT fora definite plan, through which youintend to exchange</p>\n<p>services ormerchandise in return forthemoney you arevisualizing, but begin at</p>\n<p>onceto see yourself in possession ofthe money, DEMANDING and EXPECTING</p>\n<p>meanwhile, that your subconscious mind will hand over theplan, orplans you</p>\n<p>need.

Having hadsome bookkeeping experience, he took a special</p>\n<p>course in accounting, familiarized himself with all the latest bookkeeping and</p>\n<p>officeequipment, andwent into business for himself. Starting with thegrocer for</p>\n<p>whom  hehadformerly worked, hemade contracts with more than 100 small</p>\n<p>merchants to keep theirbooks, at a very nominal monthly fee. His idea was so</p>\n<p>practical that hesoon found it necessary to set upa portable officein a light</p>\n<p>delivery truck, which he equipped with modern bookkeeping machinery. He</p>\n<p>now has a fleet of these bookkeeping offices \"on wheels\" and employs a large</p>\n<p>staff of assistants, thus providing small merchants with accounting service equal</p>\n<p>to thebest that money can buy, at very nominal cost.</p>\n<p>Specialized knowledge, plus imagination, were the ingredients thatwent</p>\n<p>into this unique and successful business. Last yearthe owner of thatbusiness</p>\n<p>paid an income tax ofalmost ten times as much as was paid by themerchant for</p>\n<p>whom  heworked when thedepression forced upon him a temporary adversity</p>\n<p>which proved to be a blessing in disguise.</p>\n<p>Thebeginning ofthis successful business was an IDEA!</p>\n<p>Inasmuch as Ihadthe privilege ofsupplying theunemployed salesman</p>\n<p>with that idea, I now assumethe further privilege ofsuggesting another idea</p>\n<p>which has within it thepossibility ofeven greater income.

This faculty creates nothing.</p>\n<p>It merely works with the material ofexperience, education, and observation with</p>\n<p>which it is fed.

Theinformationhere conveyed will</p>\n<p>be of practical help to any person having any form of personal services to</p>\n<p>market, but it will be of priceless benefit to thosewho aspire to leadership in</p>\n<p>their chosen occupations.</p>\n<p>Intelligent planning is essential for success in any undertaking designed to</p>\n<p>accumulate riches. Here will be found detailed instructions to those who must</p>\n<p>begin theaccumulation ofriches by selling personal services.</p>\n<p>It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes</p>\n<p>began in theform ofcompensation for personal services, orfrom thesaleof</p>\n<p>IDEAS. What else, except ideas andpersonal services, would one not possessed</p>\n<p>of property have to give in return forriches?</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of people in theworld. Onetype is</p>\n<p>known as LEADERS, and theother as FOLLOWERS. Decide at the outset</p>\n<p>whether youintend to become a leader in your chosen calling, orremain a</p>\n<p>follower. The difference in compensation is vast. The follower cannot reasonably</p>\n<p>expect thecompensation to which a leader is entitled, although many followers</p>\n<p>makethe mistakeof expecting such pay.</p>\n<p>It is no disgrace to be a follower. On theotherhand, it is no credit to</p>\n<p>remain a follower. Most great leaders began in the capacity of followers. They</p>\n<p>became great leaders because they were INTELLIGENT FOLLOWERS. With few</p>\n<p>exceptions, theman who cannotfollow a leader intelligently, cannot become an</p>\n<p>efficient leader. Theman who can follow a leader most efficiently, is usually the</p>\n<p>man who develops into leadership most rapidly. An intelligent follower has</p>\n<p>many advantages, among them the OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE</p>\n<p>KNOWLEDGE   FROM HIS LEADER.</p>\n<p>THEMAJOR  ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 103</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Thefollowing areimportant factors ofleadership:—</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNWAVERING  COURAGE based upon knowledge ofself, and ofone\'s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>occupation.

Theman who cannotcontrol himself, can never</li>\n</ul>\n<p>control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one\'s followers, which the</p>\n<p>more intelligent will emulate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE.Withouta sense offairness and justice, no</li>\n</ul>\n<p>leader can command andretain therespect of his followers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DEFINITENESS OF DECISION.

No slovenly, careless person can become</li>\n</ul>\n<p>a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will notrespect a</p>\n<p>leader who does notgrade high on all of the factors ofa Pleasing Personality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING.

Leadership calls forPOWER, and power calls forCOOPERATION.</p>\n<p>There are two forms of Leadership. The first, andby far themost effective,</p>\n<p>is LEADERSHIP BY CONSENT of, andwith thesympathy ofthe followers. The</p>\n<p>second is LEADERSHIP BY FORCE, withoutthe consent andsympathy of the</p>\n<p>followers.</p>\n<p>History is filled with evidences thatLeadership by Force cannotendure.</p>\n<p>Thedownfall anddisappearance of\"Dictators\" and kings is significant. It means</p>\n<p>that people will notfollow forced leadership indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Theworldhas just entered a new era of relationship between leaders and</p>\n<p>followers, which very clearly calls fornew leaders, anda new brand of</p>\n<p>leadership in business andindustry.

In thefuture, therelationship of employerand</p>\n<p>employee will be more likea partnership than it has been in the past.</p>\n<p>Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, theCzar ofRussia, and theKing</p>\n<p>of Spain were examples ofleadership by force. Their leadership passed.

Atthe end of thedepression, the</p>\n<p>demand forleaders who are competent to apply thenew methods ofleadership</p>\n<p>has greatly exceeded the supply. Some ofthe old typeof leaders will reform and</p>\n<p>adapt themselves to the new brand of leadership, but generally speaking, the</p>\n<p>world will have to look for new timber forits leadership. This necessity may be</p>\n<p>your OPPORTUNITY!</p>\n<p>THE10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP</p>\n<p>We come now to the majorfaults ofleaders who fail, because it is just as</p>\n<p>essential to know WHAT NOT TODOas it is to know what to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>INABILITY TOORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>leadership calls for ability to organize andto master details. No</p>\n<p>genuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be</p>\n<p>required ofhim in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he</p>\n<p>is a leader orfollower, admits that heis \"too busy\" to changehis</p>\n<p>plans, orto give attention to any emergency, he admits his</p>\n<p>inefficiency. The successful leader must be themaster of all details</p>\n<p>connected with his position. Thatmeans, of course, thathe must</p>\n<p>acquire thehabit ofrelegating details to capable lieutenants.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNWILLINGNESS TORENDER  HUMBLE SERVICE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Truly great leaders arewilling, when occasion demands, to perform</p>\n<p>any sort oflabor which they would ask another to perform. \"The</p>\n<p>greatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all</p>\n<p>able leaders observe and respect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY \"KNOW\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>INSTEAD OF WHAT  THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY</p>\n<p>KNOW.  Theworld does notpay men forthat which they \"know.\" It</p>\n<p>pays them forwhat they DO, orinduce others to do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FEAR OF COMPETITION FROMFOLLOWERS. The</li>\n</ul>\n<p>leader who fears that oneof his followers may take his position is</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 106</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>practically sure to realize thatfear sooner orlater. Theable leader</p>\n<p>trains understudies to whom hemay delegate, at will, any of the</p>\n<p>details ofhis position. Only in this way may a leader multiply</p>\n<p>himselfandprepare himself to be at many places, and give</p>\n<p>attention to many things at onetime. It is an eternal truth thatmen</p>\n<p>receive more pay fortheir ABILITY TOGET OTHERS TO</p>\n<p>PERFORM, than they couldpossibly earn by their own efforts. An</p>\n<p>efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his joband the</p>\n<p>magnetism of his personality, greatly increase theefficiency of</p>\n<p>others, and induce them to render more service and better service</p>\n<p>than they could render without his aid.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the</li>\n</ul>\n<p>leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, andofcreating plans</p>\n<p>by which to guide his followers efficiently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SELFISHNESS. Theleader who claims all thehonorforthe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. Thereally</p>\n<p>great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. Heis contented to</p>\n<p>see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he</p>\n<p>knows that most men will work harder forcommendation and</p>\n<p>recognition than they will for money alone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an</li>\n</ul>\n<p>intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any ofits various</p>\n<p>forms, destroys the endurance andthevitality of all who indulgein</p>\n<p>it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this shouldhavecomeat thehead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>of thelist. Theleader who is notloyal to his trust, and to his</p>\n<p>associates, those abovehim, andthose below him, cannot long</p>\n<p>maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks oneas being less than the</p>\n<p>dust ofthe earth, andbrings down on one\'s head thecontempt he</p>\n<p>deserves. Lack of loyalty is oneof themajorcauses of failure in</p>\n<p>every walk of life.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 107</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Theefficient leader leads by encouraging, andnot by trying to instil</p>\n<p>fear in thehearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress</p>\n<p>his followers with his \"authority\" comes within thecategory of</p>\n<p>leadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, hewill</p>\n<p>haveno need to advertise thatfact except by his conduct— his</p>\n<p>sympathy, understanding, fairness, anda demonstration that he</p>\n<p>knows his job.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EMPHASIS OF TITLE.Thecompetent leader requires no</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"title\" to give him the respect ofhis followers. Theman who makes</p>\n<p>too much over his titlegenerally has little else to emphasize. The</p>\n<p>doorsto theoffice of thereal leader are open to all who wish to</p>\n<p>enter, andhis working quarters arefree from formality or</p>\n<p>ostentation.</p>\n<p>Theseare among the more common of thecauses offailure in leadership.</p>\n<p>Any oneof thesefaults is sufficient to induce failure. Study thelist carefully if</p>\n<p>youaspire to leadership, andmake sure thatyouare free of these faults.</p>\n<p>SOME FERTILE FIELDS IN WHICH \"NEW LEADERSHIP\" WILL</p>\n<p>BEREQUIRED</p>\n<p>Before leaving this chapter, yourattention is called to a few of thefertile</p>\n<p>fields in which there has been a decline of leadership, andin which thenew type</p>\n<p>of leader may findan abundance ofOPPORTUNITY.</p>\n<p>First. In thefield ofpolitics there is a most insistent demand</p>\n<p>fornew leaders; a demand which indicates nothing less than an</p>\n<p>emergency. The majority of politicians have, seemingly, become</p>\n<p>high-grade, legalizedracketeers. They have increased taxes and</p>\n<p>debauched themachinery ofindustry andbusiness until thepeople</p>\n<p>can no longer stand theburden.</p>\n<p>Second. The banking business is undergoing a reform. The</p>\n<p>leaders in this field havealmost entirely lost theconfidence of the</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 108</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>public. Already thebankers have sensed theneed of reform, and</p>\n<p>they have begun it.</p>\n<p>Third. Industry calls fornew leaders. Theold typeof leaders</p>\n<p>thoughtandmoved in terms ofdividends instead ofthinking and</p>\n<p>moving in terms ofhuman equations! Thefuture leader in industry,</p>\n<p>to endure, must regard himself as a quasi-public official whose</p>\n<p>duty it is to managehis trust in such a way that it will work</p>\n<p>hardship on no individual, orgroup ofindividuals. Exploitation of</p>\n<p>working men is a thing of thepast. Let the man who aspires to</p>\n<p>leadership in the field ofbusiness, industry, andlabor remember</p>\n<p>this.</p>\n<p>Fourth. Thereligious leader ofthe future will be forced to</p>\n<p>givemore attention to the temporal needs of his followers, in the</p>\n<p>solution of their economicandpersonal problems of thepresent,</p>\n<p>andless attention to the dead past, andthe yet unborn future.</p>\n<p>Fifth. In the professions of law, medicine, andeducation, a</p>\n<p>new brand of leadership, and to someextent, new leaders will</p>\n<p>become a necessity. This is especially true in thefield of education.</p>\n<p>Theleader in that fieldmust, in the future, find ways and means of</p>\n<p>teaching peopleHOW TOAPPLY theknowledge they receive in</p>\n<p>school. He must deal more with PRACTICE andless with</p>\n<p>THEORY.</p>\n<p>Sixth. New leaders will be required in the field of</p>\n<p>Journalism. Newspapers of thefuture, to be conducted</p>\n<p>successfully, must be divorced from \"special privilege\" and relieved</p>\n<p>from the subsidy of advertising. They must cease to be organs of</p>\n<p>propaganda forthe interests which patronizetheir advertising</p>\n<p>columns. The typeof newspaper which publishes scandal andlewd</p>\n<p>pictures will eventually go theway of all forces which debauch the</p>\n<p>human mind.</p>\n<p>Theseare but a few of the fields in which opportunities fornew leaders</p>\n<p>anda new brand ofleadership are now available.

Give it a goodsuit of</p>\n<p>clothes, so it will stand outin bold contrast to anything your prospective</p>\n<p>employer ever saw, in theway of an application fora position. If theposition you</p>\n<p>seek is worth having, it is worth going after with care.

There is no substitute</p>\n<p>forPERSISTENCE. Theperson who makes PERSISTENCE his</p>\n<p>watch-word, discoversthat \"Old Man Failure\" finally becomes</p>\n<p>tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with</p>\n<p>PERSISTENCE.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NEGATIVEPERSONALITY. There is no hope ofsuccess</li>\n</ul>\n<p>forthe person who repels peoplethrough a negative personality.</p>\n<p>Success comes through the application of POWER, andpower is</p>\n<p>attained through the cooperative efforts ofother people. A negative</p>\n<p>personality will not induce cooperation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE. Sex energy is</li>\n</ul>\n<p>the most powerful of all the stimuli which move peopleinto</p>\n<p>ACTION. Because it is the most powerful of theemotions, it must</p>\n<p>be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other</p>\n<p>channels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR \"SOMETHING FOR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTHING.\" The gambling instinctdrives millions ofpeople to</p>\n<p>failure. Evidence of this may be found in a study ofthe Wall Street</p>\n<p>crash of\'29, during which millions of people tried to make money</p>\n<p>by gambling on stock margins.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 122</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at</p>\n<p>all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly,</p>\n<p>andchange them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and</p>\n<p>procrastination are twin brothers. Where oneis found, the other</p>\n<p>may usually be found also.

These fears</li>\n</ul>\n<p>havebeen analyzed foryou in a later chapter. They must be</p>\n<p>mastered before youcan market your services effectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF A MATEIN MARRIAGE. This</li>\n</ul>\n<p>a most common cause of failure. Therelationship ofmarriage</p>\n<p>brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is</p>\n<p>harmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form</p>\n<p>of failure thatis marked by misery andunhappiness, destroying all</p>\n<p>signs of AMBITION.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OVER-CAUTION. Theperson who takesno chances,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>generally has to take whatever is leftwhen others are through</p>\n<p>choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are</p>\n<p>extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element</p>\n<p>of chance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is oneofthe most common causes of failure in business. In</p>\n<p>marketing personal services, one shoulduse great care to select an</p>\n<p>employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself,</p>\n<p>intelligent andsuccessful. Weemulate those with whom we</p>\n<p>associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep</p>\n<p>open minds andare afraid ofnothing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. Noman can</li>\n</ul>\n<p>succeed in a lineof endeavor which hedoesnot like. Themost</p>\n<p>essential stepin the marketing ofpersonal services is that of</p>\n<p>selecting an occupation into which youcan throw yourself</p>\n<p>wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 123</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT.

Themost damaging forms of</li>\n</ul>\n<p>intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, andsexual</p>\n<p>activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>INABILITY TOCOOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More</li>\n</ul>\n<p>people lose their positions andtheir big opportunities in life,</p>\n<p>because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined.

(Sons anddaughters of wealthy men,</p>\n<p>andothers who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in</p>\n<p>the hands ofonewho did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to</p>\n<p>success.

There is but little doubt that Mr.</p>\n<p>Ford\'s habitof definiteness of decision assumes theproportion of obstinacy, but</p>\n<p>this quality is preferable to slowness in reaching decisions andquickness in</p>\n<p>changing them.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 140</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Themajority ofpeople who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their</p>\n<p>needs, are, generally, easily influenced by the \"opinions\" of others.

But weknow little ofthe real forces back of these names, dates, and</p>\n<p>places. Weknow still less of that intangiblePOWER, which insured us freedom</p>\n<p>long before Washington\'s armies reached Yorktown.</p>\n<p>We read the history ofthe Revolution, and falsely imagine thatGeorge</p>\n<p>Washington was theFather of our Country, thatit was hewho won ourfreedom,</p>\n<p>while thetruth is—Washington was only an accessory after thefact, because</p>\n<p>victory forhis armies hadbeen insured long before Lord Cornwallis</p>\n<p>surrendered. This is not intended to robWashington of any of theglory heso</p>\n<p>richly merited. Its purpose, rather, is to givegreater attention to theastounding</p>\n<p>POWER  thatwas thereal cause ofhis victory.</p>\n<p>It is nothing shortof tragedy that thewriters ofhistory have missed,</p>\n<p>entirely, even theslightest reference to theirresistible POWER, which gave birth</p>\n<p>andfreedom to the nation destined to set upnew standards of independence for</p>\n<p>all the peoples of theearth. I say it is a tragedy, because it is theself-same</p>\n<p>POWER  which must be used by every individual who surmounts thedifficulties</p>\n<p>of Life, and forces Life to pay theprice asked.</p>\n<p>Let us briefly review theevents which gave birth to this POWER. The</p>\n<p>story begins with an incident in Boston, March 5, 1770. British soldiers were</p>\n<p>patroling thestreets, by their presence, openly threatening the citizens. The</p>\n<p>colonists resented armed men marching in their midst. They began to express</p>\n<p>their resentment openly, hurling stones as well as epithets, at the marching</p>\n<p>soldiers, until thecommanding officer gaveorders, \"Fix bayonets. . . . Charge!\"</p>\n<p>Thebattle was on. It resulted in thedeath andinjury ofmany. The</p>\n<p>incident aroused such resentment that the Provincial Assembly, (made upof</p>\n<p>prominent colonists), called a meeting for thepurpose of taking definite action.</p>\n<p>Two of themembers ofthat Assembly were, John Hancock, andSamuel Adams</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LONG  LIVE THEIR NAMES! They spoke upcourageously, and declared that a</li>\n</ul>\n<p>movemust be made to eject all British soldiers from Boston.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 143</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Remember this—a DECISION, in the minds oftwo men, might properly</p>\n<p>be called the beginning of thefreedom which we, of theUnited States now enjoy.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that theDECISION ofthese two men called for FAITH, and</p>\n<p>COURAGE,  because it was dangerous.</p>\n<p>Before theAssembly adjourned, Samuel Adams was appointed to call on</p>\n<p>the Governorof theProvince, Hutchinson, and demand thewithdrawal ofthe</p>\n<p>British troops.</p>\n<p>Therequest was granted, thetroops were removed from Boston, but the</p>\n<p>incident was not closed. Ithad caused a situation destined to change theentire</p>\n<p>trend ofcivilization. Strange, is it not, how thegreat changes, such as the</p>\n<p>American Revolution, andthe World War, often have theirbeginnings in</p>\n<p>circumstances which seem unimportant? It is interesting, also, to observe that</p>\n<p>these important changes usually begin in the form ofa DEFINITE DECISION in</p>\n<p>the minds ofa relatively small number of people. Few of us know the history of</p>\n<p>our country well enough to realize thatJohn Hancock, SamuelAdams, and</p>\n<p>Richard Henry Lee (of the Province ofVirginia) were the real Fathers ofour</p>\n<p>Country.</p>\n<p>Richard Henry Lee became an important factor in this story by reason of</p>\n<p>the factthat he andSamuel Adams communicated frequently (by</p>\n<p>correspondence), sharing freely their fearsand theirhopes concerning the</p>\n<p>welfare ofthe peopleof their Provinces. From this practice, Adams conceived the</p>\n<p>idea that a mutual exchangeof letters between the thirteen Colonies might help</p>\n<p>to bring about thecoordination of effortso badly needed in connection with the</p>\n<p>solution of their problems. Two years after theclash with the soldiers in Boston</p>\n<p>(March \'72), Adams presented this ideato the Assembly, in theform of a motion</p>\n<p>that a Correspondence Committee be established among theColonies, with</p>\n<p>definitely appointed correspondents in each Colony, \"forthe purpose offriendly</p>\n<p>cooperation forthebetterment of theColonies of British America.\"</p>\n<p>Mark well this incident! It was thebeginning ofthe organization ofthe</p>\n<p>far-flung POWER destined to give freedom to you,and to me. TheMaster Mind</p>\n<p>hadalready been organized. It consisted ofAdams, Lee, andHancock. \"Itell you</p>\n<p>further, that if two of youagree upon theearth concerning anything forwhich</p>\n<p>youask, it will come to youfrom My Father, who is in Heaven.\"</p>\n<p>TheCommittee of Correspondence was organized. Observe thatthis move</p>\n<p>provided the way for increasing thepower ofthe Master Mind by adding to it</p>\n<p>men from all the Colonies. Take notice thatthis procedure constituted the first</p>\n<p>ORGANIZED  PLANNING  of thedisgruntled Colonists.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 144</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>In union there is strength! The citizens of theColonies hadbeen waging</p>\n<p>disorganized warfare against theBritish soldiers, through incidents similar to the</p>\n<p>Boston riot, but nothing of benefit hadbeen accomplished. Their individual</p>\n<p>grievances hadnotbeen consolidated under oneMaster Mind. No group of</p>\n<p>individuals had put their hearts, minds, souls, andbodies together in one</p>\n<p>definite DECISION to settle their difficulty with theBritish once andfor all, until</p>\n<p>Adams, Hancock, andLee gottogether.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the British were not idle. They, too, were doing some</p>\n<p>PLANNING  and\"Master-Minding\" on their own account, with the advantageof</p>\n<p>having back ofthem money, andorganized soldiery.</p>\n<p>TheCrown appointed Gageto supplant Hutchinson as theGovernor of</p>\n<p>Massachusetts. One of thenew Governor\'s first acts was to send a messenger to</p>\n<p>call on Samuel Adams, for thepurpose of endeavoring to stop his opposition—</p>\n<p>by FEAR.</p>\n<p>We can best understand the spiritof what happened by quoting the</p>\n<p>conversation between Col. Fenton, (themessenger sent by Gage), andAdams.</p>\n<p>Col. Fenton: \"Ihavebeen authorized by GovernorGage,to assure you,</p>\n<p>Mr. Adams, that theGovernor has been empowered to confer upon yousuch</p>\n<p>benefits as wouldbe satisfactory, [endeavor to win Adams by promiseof bribes],</p>\n<p>upon the condition that youengage to cease in youropposition to themeasures</p>\n<p>of thegovernment.

Themajority of men would have</p>\n<p>foundit difficult to reach such a decision. Themajority would havesent back an</p>\n<p>evasive reply, but notAdams! He insisted upon Col.

(Racketeers anddishonest</p>\n<p>politicians have prostituted the honorfor which such men as Adams died).</p>\n<p>When Governor Gage received Adams\' caustic reply, heflew into a rage,</p>\n<p>andissued a proclamation which read, \"Ido, hereby, in his majesty\'s name, offer</p>\n<p>andpromise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay</p>\n<p>down their arms, andreturn to theduties of peaceable subjects, excepting only</p>\n<p>from the benefit of such pardon, SAMUEL ADAMS AND JOHN HANCOCK,</p>\n<p>whoseoffencesare of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration</p>\n<p>but that of condign punishment.\"</p>\n<p>As onemight say, in modern slang, Adams and Hancock were \"onthe</p>\n<p>spot!\" The threat of the irate Governorforced the two men to reach another</p>\n<p>DECISION, equally as dangerous. They hurriedly called a secret meeting oftheir</p>\n<p>staunchest followers. (Here theMaster Mind began to takeonmomentum). After</p>\n<p>the meeting had been called to order, Adams locked the door,placed thekey in</p>\n<p>his pocket, andinformed all present that it was imperative thata Congress of the</p>\n<p>Colonists be organized, andthatNOMAN SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM</p>\n<p>UNTIL THEDECISION FOR SUCH ACONGRESS  HAD  BEEN REACHED.</p>\n<p>Great excitement followed. Someweighed the possible consequences of</p>\n<p>such radicalism. (Old Man Fear). Some expressed gravedoubt as to the wisdom</p>\n<p>of so definite a decision in defiance of theCrown. Locked in thatroom were TWO</p>\n<p>MEN  immuneto Fear, blind to thepossibility ofFailure. Hancock andAdams.</p>\n<p>Through the influence of theirminds, the others were induced to agree that,</p>\n<p>through the Correspondence Committee, arrangements should be made fora</p>\n<p>meeting ofthe First Continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia, September</p>\n<ul>\n<li>, 1774.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember this date.

Inspired by the threat, one ofJefferson\'s colleagues, Patrick Henry,</p>\n<p>boldly spoke his mind, concluding his remarks with a sentence which shall</p>\n<p>remain forever a classic, \"If this be treason, then make the most of it.\"</p>\n<p>It was such men as these who, withoutpower, withoutauthority, without</p>\n<p>military strength, without money, sat in solemn consideration ofthe destiny of</p>\n<p>the colonies, beginning at theopening ofthe First Continental Congress, and</p>\n<p>continuing at intervals fortwo years— until onJune 7, 1776, RichardHenry Lee</p>\n<p>arose, addressed theChair, and to the startled Assembly made this motion:</p>\n<p>\"Gentlemen, Imakethe motion that theseUnited Colonies are, and of</p>\n<p>right ought to be free andindependent states, that they be absolved from all</p>\n<p>allegiance to theBritish Crown, and thatall political connection between them</p>\n<p>andthe state ofGreat Britain is, andought to betotally dissolved.\"</p>\n<p>Lee\'s astounding motion was discussed fervently, andat such length that</p>\n<p>he began to lose patience. Finally, after days ofargument, he again took the floor,</p>\n<p>anddeclared, in a clear, firm voice, \"Mr.President, we have discussed this issue</p>\n<p>fordays. It is the only course for us to follow. Why, then Sir, do welonger delay?</p>\n<p>Why still deliberate? Let this happy day givebirth to an American Republic.

Thehabittakes on</p>\n<p>permanency as the youth goes through graded school, high school, andeven</p>\n<p>through college, withoutDEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Themajor weakness of</p>\n<p>all educational systems is that they neither teach nor encourage thehabitof</p>\n<p>DEFINITE DECISION.</p>\n<p>It would be beneficial if no college would permit the enrollmentof any</p>\n<p>student, unless anduntil the student declared his majorpurpose in</p>\n<p>matriculating. It would be of still greater benefit, if every student who enters the</p>\n<p>graded schools were compelled to accept training in the HABIT OF DECISION,</p>\n<p>andforced to pass a satisfactory examination on this subject before being</p>\n<p>permitted to advance in thegrades.</p>\n<p>Thehabitof INDECISION acquired because of thedeficiencies ofour</p>\n<p>school systems, goes with thestudent into theoccupation hechooses . . . IF . . in</p>\n<p>fact, hechooses his occupation. Generally, the youth just outofschool seeks any</p>\n<p>jobthat can befound. He takesthe first place hefinds, because hehas fallen into</p>\n<p>the habitof INDECISION. Ninety-eight outof every hundred people working for</p>\n<p>wages today, are in thepositions they hold, because they lacked the</p>\n<p>DEFINITENESS OF DECISION to PLAN ADEFINITEPOSITION, and the</p>\n<p>knowledge of how to choosean employer.</p>\n<p>DEFINITENESS OF DECISION always requires courage, sometimes very</p>\n<p>great courage. The fifty-six men who signed the Declaration ofIndependence</p>\n<p>staked their lives on the DECISION to affix their signatures to that document.</p>\n<p>Theperson who reaches a DEFINITEDECISION to procure theparticular job,</p>\n<p>andmake life pay theprice heasks, does not stake his life on that decision; he</p>\n<p>stakes his ECONOMIC FREEDOM. Financial independence, riches, desirable</p>\n<p>business andprofessional positions are not within reach of theperson who</p>\n<p>neglects orrefuses to EXPECT, PLAN, andDEMAND these things. Theperson</p>\n<p>who desires riches in thesamespirit that Samuel Adams desired freedom for the</p>\n<p>Colonies, is sure to accumulate wealth.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 149</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>In thechapter on Organized Planning, youwill findcomplete instructions</p>\n<p>formarketing every type of personal services.

Likeall states of</p>\n<p>mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:—</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what onewants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>is the first and,perhaps, themost important step toward the</p>\n<p>development of persistence. Astrong motive forces oneto</p>\n<p>surmount many difficulties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>b. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire andto</li>\n</ul>\n<p>maintain persistence in pursuing the object ofintense desire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>c. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one\'s ability to carry outa plan</li>\n</ul>\n<p>encourages one to follow theplan through with persistence. (Self-</p>\n<p>reliance can be developed through the principle described in the</p>\n<p>chapter onauto-suggestion).</p>\n<p>d. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even</p>\n<p>though they may be weak andentirely impractical, encourage</p>\n<p>persistence.</p>\n<p>e. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE.  Knowing that one\'s plans are</p>\n<p>sound, based upon experience orobservation, encourages</p>\n<p>persistence; \"guessing\" instead of\"knowing\" destroys persistence.</p>\n<p>f. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and</p>\n<p>harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence.</p>\n<p>g. WILL-POWER. Thehabit ofconcentrating one\'s thoughts</p>\n<p>upon the building of plans forthe attainment of a definite 164 164</p>\n<p>Page 165 166 165 purpose, leads to persistence.</p>\n<p>h. HABIT. Persistence is thedirect result ofhabit. Themind</p>\n<p>absorbs andbecomes a part ofthe daily experiences upon which it</p>\n<p>feeds. Fear, the worst ofall enemies, can be effectively cured by</p>\n<p>forced repetition ofacts of courage.

Mohammed was born to impoverished</p>\n<p>members ofa leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads ofthe</p>\n<p>world, homeof themagic stone called theCaaba, great city of trade andthe</p>\n<p>center oftrade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be raised in the</p>\n<p>desert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing strength and health</p>\n<p>from the milk of nomad,vicarious mothers. He tended sheep andsoon hired out</p>\n<p>to a rich widow as leader ofher caravans. He traveled to all parts of theEastern</p>\n<p>World,talked with many men of diverse beliefs andobserved the decline of</p>\n<p>Christianity into warring sects. When hewas twenty-eight, Khadija, thewidow,</p>\n<p>looked upon him with favor,andmarried him. Her father wouldhaveobjected</p>\n<p>to such a marriage, soshe got him drunk and heldhim up while hegave the</p>\n<p>paternal blessing. Forthenext twelve years Mohammed livedas a rich and</p>\n<p>respected andvery shrewd trader. Then hetook to wandering in the desert, and</p>\n<p>oneday he returned with the first verse ofthe Koran andtold Khadija thatthe</p>\n<p>archangel Gabriel had appeared to him andsaid that hewas to be the Messenger</p>\n<p>of God.</p>\n<p>\"The Koran, therevealed wordof God, was the closest thing to a miracle</p>\n<p>in Mohammed\'s life. Hehadnotbeen a poet;he had no gift ofwords. Yetthe</p>\n<p>verses of theKoran, as hereceived them andrecited them to the faithful, were</p>\n<p>better than any verses which theprofessional poets ofthe tribes couldproduce.</p>\n<p>This, to the Arabs, was a miracle. Tothem thegift of words was thegreatest gift,</p>\n<p>the poet was all-powerful. In addition the Koran said thatall men were equal</p>\n<p>before God, that the world should be a democratic state— Islam. Itwas this</p>\n<p>political heresy, plus Mohammed\'s desire to destroy all the360 idols in the</p>\n<p>courtyard of theCaaba, which brought about his banishment. Theidols brought</p>\n<p>the desert tribes to Mecca, andthat meant trade. So thebusiness men ofMecca,</p>\n<p>the capitalists, ofwhich he hadbeen one,setupon Mohammed. Then he</p>\n<p>retreated to thedesert anddemanded sovereignty overthe world.</p>\n<p>\"The riseof Islam began.

Itconsists of one\'s THINKING PROCESS. The</p>\n<p>positiveemotions of thought form the side of thestream which carries oneto</p>\n<p>fortune.

His methodis both significantand interesting to one</p>\n<p>interested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr.Gates,</p>\n<p>unquestionably belonged. Dr.Gates was one ofthe really great, though less</p>\n<p>publicized scientists of theworld.</p>\n<p>In his laboratory, he had what hecalled his \"personal communication</p>\n<p>room.\" It was practically sound proof, andso arranged thatall light couldbe shut</p>\n<p>out.It was equipped with a small table, on which hekept a pad of writing paper.</p>\n<p>In front of thetable, on thewall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the</p>\n<p>lights. When Dr.Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through</p>\n<p>his Creative Imagination, hewould go into this room, seat himself at the table,</p>\n<p>shutoff thelights, andCONCENTRATEupon the KNOWN factors ofthe</p>\n<p>invention onwhich hewas working, remaining in that position until ideas began</p>\n<p>to \"flash\" into his mind in connection with theUNKNOWN factors ofthe</p>\n<p>invention.</p>\n<p>On oneoccasion, ideas came through so fast that hewas forced to write</p>\n<p>foralmost three hours.

The</p>\n<p>scientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use ofboth the</p>\n<p>synthetic and thecreative faculties ofimagination.</p>\n<p>Forexample, thescientific inventor,or\"genius, begins an invention by</p>\n<p>organizing andcombining theknown ideas, orprinciples accumulated through</p>\n<p>experience, through thesyntheticfaculty (thereasoning faculty). If he finds this</p>\n<p>accumulated knowledge to be insufficient forthe completion ofhis invention, he</p>\n<p>then draws upon the sources of knowledge availableto him through his creative</p>\n<p>faculty. The method by which hedoesthis varies with theindividual, but this is</p>\n<p>the sum andsubstance of his procedure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HESTIMULATES  HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON AHIGHER-</li>\n</ul>\n<p>THAN-AVERAGEPLANE,   using one ormoreof theten mind stimulants or</p>\n<p>some otherstimulant ofhis choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HECONCENTRATES   uponthe known factors(the finished part) of his</li>\n</ul>\n<p>invention, and creates in his mind a perfect picture ofunknown factors(the</p>\n<p>unfinished part), of his invention. Heholds this picture in mind until it has been</p>\n<p>taken over by thesubconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL</p>\n<p>thought, andwaits forhis answer to \"flash\" into his mind.</p>\n<p>Sometimes theresults are both definite andimmediate. At other times, the</p>\n<p>results are negative, depending upon thestate ofdevelopment ofthe \"sixth</p>\n<p>sense,\" orcreative faculty.</p>\n<p>Mr. Edison tried outmore than 10,000 different combinations of ideas</p>\n<p>through the synthetic faculty of his imagination before he \"tuned in\" through the</p>\n<p>creative faculty, andgot theanswer which perfected theincandescent light.

People who</p>\n<p>lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire others with</p>\n<p>enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is oneof themost important requisites in</p>\n<p>salesmanship, no matter what oneis selling.</p>\n<p>Thepublic speaker, orator,preacher, lawyer, orsalesman who is lacking</p>\n<p>in sex energy is a \"flop,\" as far as being able to influence others is concerned.</p>\n<p>Couple with this thefact, that most people can be influenced only through an</p>\n<p>appeal to their emotions, andyouwill understand theimportance of sex energy</p>\n<p>as a part ofthe salesman\'s native ability.

Not every person knows, however, that</p>\n<p>over indulgence in sex expression may become a habitas destructive andas</p>\n<p>detrimental to creative effort as narcotics orliquor.</p>\n<p>A sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man!

Briefly, the process may be stated as follows:</p>\n<p>Encourage the presence ofthese emotions as the dominating thoughts in</p>\n<p>one\'s mind, anddiscourage thepresence of all thedestructive emotions. The</p>\n<p>mind is a creature ofhabit. It thrives upon the dominating thoughts fed it.</p>\n<p>Through the faculty of will-power, onemay discourage thepresence of any</p>\n<p>emotion, and encourage thepresence of any other.

Gates, observed that every</p>\n<p>human brain is both a broadcasting andreceiving station forthe vibration of</p>\n<p>thought.</p>\n<p>Through the medium ofthe ether, in a fashion similar to that employed by</p>\n<p>the radio broadcasting principle, every human brain is capable ofpicking up</p>\n<p>vibrations of thought which are being released by other brains.</p>\n<p>In connection with the statement in the preceding paragraph, compare,</p>\n<p>andconsider the description of theCreative Imagination, as outlinedin the</p>\n<p>chapter onImagination. TheCreative Imagination is the \"receiving set\" of the</p>\n<p>brain, which receives thoughts, released by the brains of others. It is the agency</p>\n<p>of communication between one\'s conscious, orreasoning mind, and thefour</p>\n<p>sources from which one may receive thought stimuli.</p>\n<p>When stimulated, or\"stepped up\" to a high rate ofvibration, the mind</p>\n<p>becomes more receptive to the vibration ofthoughtwhich reaches it through the</p>\n<p>ether from outside sources. This \"stepping up\" process takesplace through the</p>\n<p>positiveemotions, orthe negativeemotions. Through theemotions, the</p>\n<p>vibrations of thought may be increased.</p>\n<p>Vibrations ofan exceedingly high rate are theonly vibrations picked up</p>\n<p>andcarried, by the ether, from onebrain to another. Thought is energy travelling</p>\n<p>at an exceedingly high rate ofvibration. Thought, which has been modified or</p>\n<p>\"stepped up\" by any of themajoremotions, vibrates at a much higher rate than</p>\n<p>ordinary thought, andit is this typeof thoughtwhich passes from one brain to</p>\n<p>another, through the broadcasting machinery ofthe human brain.</p>\n<p>Theemotion of sex stands at the head ofthe list of human emotions, as far</p>\n<p>as intensity anddriving force are concerned.

On theother hand, whenthe brain is</p>\n<p>vibrating at a rapid rate, it notonly attracts thoughts and ideas released by other</p>\n<p>brains through themedium ofthe ether, but it gives to one\'s own thoughts that</p>\n<p>\"feeling\" which is essential before thosethoughts will be picked up and acted</p>\n<p>upon by one\'s subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>Thus, youwill see that the broadcasting principle is thefactor through</p>\n<p>which youmix feeling, oremotion with yourthoughts and pass them onto your</p>\n<p>subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>Thesubconscious mind is the\"sending station\" ofthe brain, through</p>\n<p>which vibrations of thought are broadcast.

My purpose was to rebuild my own character so it would</p>\n<p>represent a compositeof thecharacters of my imaginary counselors.

When hecame, hewalked very slowly,</p>\n<p>with his hands clasped behind him, andoncein a while,he would stop as he</p>\n<p>passed, andrest his hand, momentarily, upon my shoulder. Healways wore an</p>\n<p>expression ofseriousness upon his face. Rarely did Isee him smile.Thecares ofa</p>\n<p>sundered nation madehim grave.</p>\n<p>That was not true ofthe others. Burbank andPaine often indulged in witty</p>\n<p>repartee which seemed, at times, to shock theother members of thecabinet. One</p>\n<p>night Paine suggested that Iprepare a lecture on \"TheAge of Reason,\" and</p>\n<p>deliver it from thepulpit ofa church which I formerly attended. Many around</p>\n<p>the table laughedheartily at the suggestion.

Tohim thechurch was but a pawn of theState, not to be</p>\n<p>reformed, but to be used, as a convenient inciter to mass activity by thepeople.</p>\n<p>On oneoccasion Burbank was late. When hecame, he was excited with</p>\n<p>enthusiasm, and explained thathehadbeen late, because of an experiment he</p>\n<p>was making, through which hehoped to be able to grow apples on any sortof</p>\n<p>tree. Paine chided him by reminding him that it was an applewhich started all</p>\n<p>the trouble between man andwoman. Darwin chuckled heartily as hesuggested</p>\n<p>that Paine should watch outforlittle serpents, when he went into theforest to</p>\n<p>gather apples, as they had thehabit ofgrowing into big snakes. Emerson</p>\n<p>observed—\" Noserpents, no apples,\" andNapoleon remarked, \"No apples, no</p>\n<p>state!\"</p>\n<p>Lincoln developed the habitof always being thelastoneto leavethe table</p>\n<p>after each meeting. On one occasion, heleaned across theend of thetable, his</p>\n<p>arms folded, andremained in that position formany minutes. I madeno attempt</p>\n<p>to disturb him. Finally, helifted his head slowly, got upand walked to thedoor,</p>\n<p>then turned around, cameback, andlaidhis hand on my shoulder andsaid, \"My</p>\n<p>boy, you will need much courage if youremain steadfast in carrying out your</p>\n<p>purpose in life.

Edison understood and</p>\n<p>used the sixth sense in connection with the development ofinventions, especially</p>\n<p>thoseinvolving basic patents, in connection with which hehadno human</p>\n<p>experience andno accumulated knowledge to guide him, as was the case while</p>\n<p>he was working onthe talking machine, andthe moving picture machine.</p>\n<p>Nearly all great leaders, such as Napoleon, Bismark, Joan of Arc, Christ,</p>\n<p>Buddha, Confucius, and Mohammed, understood, andprobably madeuse of the</p>\n<p>sixth sensealmost continuously. The major portion of their greatness consisted of</p>\n<p>their knowledge of this principle.</p>\n<p>Thesixth senseis not something that one can takeoff andput onat will.</p>\n<p>Ability to use this great power comes slowly, through application ofthe other</p>\n<p>principles outlined in this book. Seldom does any individual come into workable</p>\n<p>knowledge of thesixth sense before theage offorty. More often theknowledge is</p>\n<p>notavailable until oneis well past fifty, and this, forthe reason thatthe spiritual</p>\n<p>forces, with which thesixth senseis soclosely related, do notmature and become</p>\n<p>usable except through years of meditation, self-examination, and serious</p>\n<p>thought.</p>\n<p>No matter who youare, orwhat may havebeen your purpose in reading</p>\n<p>this book, youcan profit by it withoutunderstanding the principle described in</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 215</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>this chapter.

Most people are fortunate if they do not suffer</p>\n<p>from the entire six. Named in theorder oftheir most common appearance, they</p>\n<p>are:—</p>\n<p>Thefear of POVERTY            } at the bottom of</p>\n<p>Thefear of CRITICISM          } most ofone\'s</p>\n<p>Thefear of ILL HEALTH         } worries</p>\n<p>Thefear of LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE</p>\n<p>Thefear of OLD AGE</p>\n<p>Thefear of DEATH</p>\n<p>All other fears are ofminor importance, they can be grouped under these</p>\n<p>six headings.</p>\n<p>Theprevalence of thesefears, as a curse to theworld, runs in cycles. For</p>\n<p>almost six years, whilethe depression was on, wefloundered in thecycle of</p>\n<p>FEAR OF POVERTY. During theworld-war, wewere in thecycle ofFEAR OF</p>\n<p>DEATH. Just following thewar, wewere in thecycle ofFEAR OF ILL HEALTH,</p>\n<p>as evidenced by the epidemic of disease which spread itself all overthe world.</p>\n<p>Fears are nothing more than states of mind. One\'s stateof mind is subject to</p>\n<p>control anddirection. Physicians, as everyone knows, are less subject to attack by</p>\n<p>disease than ordinary laymen, forthe reason that physicians DONOT FEAR</p>\n<p>DISEASE. Physicians, withoutfear orhesitation, have been known to physically</p>\n<p>contacthundreds ofpeople, daily, who were suffering from such contagious</p>\n<p>diseases as small-pox, withoutbecoming infected. Their immunity against the</p>\n<p>disease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack ofFEAR.</p>\n<p>Man can create nothing which he does not first conceive in theform of an</p>\n<p>impulse ofthought. Following this statement, comes another of still greater</p>\n<p>importance, namely, MAN\'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO</p>\n<p>TRANSLATE  THEMSELVES INTOTHEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT,</p>\n<p>WHETHER  THOSE THOUGHTS  ARE VOLUNTARY  OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>\n<p>Thought impulses which arepicked up through theether, by mere chance</p>\n<p>(thoughts which have been released by other minds) may determine one\'s</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 219</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>financial, business, professional, orsocial destiny just as surely as do the thought</p>\n<p>impulses which onecreates by intent anddesign.</p>\n<p>We are here laying the foundation forthepresentation of a factof great</p>\n<p>importance to theperson who doesnotunderstand why somepeople appear to</p>\n<p>be \"lucky\" whileothers ofequal orgreater ability, training, experience, andbrain</p>\n<p>capacity, seem destined to ride with misfortune. This fact may be explained by</p>\n<p>the statement that every human being has the ability to completely control his own</p>\n<p>mind, andwith this control, obviously, every person may open his mind to the</p>\n<p>tramp thought impulses which are being released by other brains, orclosethe</p>\n<p>doorstightly and admit only thought impulses of his own choice.</p>\n<p>Nature has endowed man with absolute control overbut onething, and</p>\n<p>that is THOUGHT. This fact, coupled with theadditional factthat everything</p>\n<p>which man creates, begins in theform of a thought, leads onevery near to the</p>\n<p>principle by which FEAR may be mastered.</p>\n<p>If it is true that ALL THOUGHT HAS A TENDENCY TOCLOTHE</p>\n<p>ITSELF IN ITS PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT (and this is true, beyond any</p>\n<p>reasonable room fordoubt), it is equally true thatthought impulses of fear and</p>\n<p>poverty cannot be translated into terms ofcourage andfinancial gain.</p>\n<p>Thepeople ofAmerica began to think of poverty, following theWall</p>\n<p>Street crash of 1929. Slowly, but surely that mass thoughtwas crystalized into its</p>\n<p>physical equivalent, which was known as a \"depression.\" This hadto happen, it</p>\n<p>is in conformity with the laws of Nature.</p>\n<h2>THE  FEAR OF POVERTY</h2>\n<p>There can be no compromisebetween POVERTY andRICHES! Thetwo</p>\n<p>roads that leadto poverty andriches travel in opposite directions. If youwant</p>\n<p>riches, youmust refuse to accept any circumstance that leads toward poverty.</p>\n<p>(Theword\"riches\" is here used in its broadest sense, meaning financial, spiritual,</p>\n<p>mental and material estates). Thestarting point of thepath that leads to richesis</p>\n<p>DESIRE. In chapter one, youreceived full instructions for theproper use of</p>\n<p>DESIRE. In this chapter, on FEAR, youhavecomplete instructions forpreparing</p>\n<p>yourmind to make practical use ofDESIRE.</p>\n<p>Here, then, is theplace to give yourself a challengewhich will definitely</p>\n<p>determine how much of this philosophy youhave absorbed. Here is thepointat</p>\n<p>which youcan turn prophetand foretell, accurately, what the future holds in</p>\n<p>store for you.If, after reading this chapter, youare willing to accept poverty, you</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 220</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>may as well makeup your mindto receive poverty. This is one decision you</p>\n<p>cannotavoid.</p>\n<p>If youdemand riches, determine what form, andhow much will be</p>\n<p>required to satisfy you. Youknow theroad that leads to riches. Youhave been</p>\n<p>givena road map which, if followed, will keep youon that road. If youneglect to</p>\n<p>makethe start, orstop before youarrive, noonewill be to blame,but YOU. This</p>\n<p>responsibility is yours. No alibi will saveyoufrom accepting theresponsibility if</p>\n<p>younow fail orrefuse to demand riches ofLife, because the acceptance calls for</p>\n<p>but onething— incidentally, theonly thing youcan control—andthat is a STATE</p>\n<p>OF MIND. Astate ofmind is something that one assumes. Itcannotbe</p>\n<p>purchased, it must be created.</p>\n<p>Fear of poverty is a stateof mind, nothing else! Butit is sufficient to</p>\n<p>destroy one\'s chances ofachievement in any undertaking, a truth which became</p>\n<p>painfully evident during thedepression.</p>\n<p>This fear paralyzes thefaculty ofreason, destroys thefaculty of</p>\n<p>imagination, kills off self-reliance, undermines enthusiasm, discourages</p>\n<p>initiative,leads to uncertainty of purpose, encourages procrastination, wipes out</p>\n<p>enthusiasm and makes self-control an impossibility. It takesthe charm from one\'s</p>\n<p>personality, destroys thepossibility of accurate thinking, diverts concentration of</p>\n<p>effort, it masters persistence, turns the will-power into nothingness, destroys</p>\n<p>ambition, beclouds the memory and invites failure in every conceivable form; it</p>\n<p>kills loveand assassinates the finer emotions of theheart, discourages friendship</p>\n<p>andinvitesdisaster in a hundred forms, leads to sleeplessness, misery and</p>\n<p>unhappiness— and all this despite theobvious truth that welivein a worldof</p>\n<p>over-abundance of everything the heartcould desire, with nothing standing</p>\n<p>between us and our desires, excepting lack of a definite purpose.</p>\n<p>TheFear ofPoverty is, without doubt, the most destructive ofthe six basic</p>\n<p>fears. It has been placed at thehead of thelist, because it is themost difficult to</p>\n<p>master. Considerable courage is required to state thetruth about theorigin of</p>\n<p>this fear, andstill greater courage to accept the truth after it has been stated. The</p>\n<p>fear of poverty grew outofman\'s inherited tendency to PREY UPON HIS</p>\n<p>FELLOW  MAN ECONOMICALLY.  Nearly all animals lower than man are</p>\n<p>motivated by instinct, but theircapacity to \"think\" is limited, therefore, they prey</p>\n<p>upon oneanother physically. Man, with his superior senseof intuition, with the</p>\n<p>capacity to think andto reason, does not eat his fellowman bodily, he gets more</p>\n<p>satisfaction outof\"eating\" him FINANCIALLY. Man is so avaricious thatevery</p>\n<p>conceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellowman.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 221</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Of all the agesof theworld,of which weknow anything, theagein which</p>\n<p>we liveseems to be onethatis outstanding because of man\'s money-madness.

Only</p>\n<p>thosewho have experienced poverty understand the full meaning ofthis.</p>\n<p>It is no wonder that man fears poverty. Through a long line of inherited</p>\n<p>experiences man has learned, forsure, thatsomemen cannot be trusted, where</p>\n<p>matters of money andearthly possessions are concerned. This is a rather stinging</p>\n<p>indictment, the worst partof it being that it is TRUE.</p>\n<p>Themajority ofmarriages are motivated by thewealth possessed by one,</p>\n<p>orboth of thecontracting parties. It is no wonder, therefore, that thedivorce</p>\n<p>courts are busy.</p>\n<p>So eager is man to possess wealth that he will acquire it in whatever</p>\n<p>manner hecan— through legal methods if possible— through othermethods if</p>\n<p>necessary orexpedient.</p>\n<p>Self-analysis may disclose weaknesses which onedoesnotlike to</p>\n<p>acknowledge. This form ofexamination is essential to all who demand ofLife</p>\n<p>more than mediocrity andpoverty. Remember, as youcheck yourself pointby</p>\n<p>point, that youare both the court and thejury, theprosecuting attorney and the</p>\n<p>attorney for thedefense, and thatyouare the plaintiff andthedefendant, also,</p>\n<p>that youare ontrial. Face the facts squarely. Ask yourself definite questions and</p>\n<p>demand direct replies. When the examination is over, youwill know more about</p>\n<p>yourself. If you do not feel thatyou can be an impartial judge in this self-</p>\n<p>examination, call upon someonewho knows youwell to serve as judge while</p>\n<p>youcross-examineyourself. Youare after the truth. Get it, nomatter at what cost</p>\n<p>even though it may temporarily embarrass you!</p>\n<p>Themajority ofpeople, if askedwhat they fear most, wouldreply, \"Ifear</p>\n<p>nothing.\" Thereply wouldbe inaccurate, because few people realize that they are</p>\n<p>bound, handicapped, whipped spiritually and physically through someform of</p>\n<p>fear. So subtle anddeeply seated is the emotion of fear thatone may gothrough</p>\n<p>life burdened with it, never recognizing its presence.

When a man is</p>\n<p>down andoutandon thestreet, unable to get any jobat all, something happens</p>\n<p>to his spirit which can be observed in thedroop of his shoulders, theset ofhis</p>\n<p>hat, his walk and his gaze.

But borrowing in itself, when a man is</p>\n<p>borrowing merely to live, is a depressing experience, andthe money lacks the</p>\n<p>power ofearned money to revive his spirits.

Some believe that this</p>\n<p>fear made its appearance aboutthe timethat politics became a \"profession.\"</p>\n<p>Others believe it can be traced to the agewhenwomen first began to concern</p>\n<p>themselves with \"styles\" in wearing apparel.</p>\n<p>This author, being neither a humorist nora prophet, is inclined to attribute</p>\n<p>the basic fear of criticism to that part ofman\'s inherited nature which prompts</p>\n<p>him not only to take away his fellowman\'s goods and wares, but to justify his</p>\n<p>action by CRITICISM ofhis fellowman\'s character. It is a well known factthat a</p>\n<p>thief will criticise theman from whom hesteals—that politicians seek office, not</p>\n<p>by displaying their own virtues andqualifications, but by attempting to besmirch</p>\n<p>their opponents.</p>\n<p>Thefear of criticism takes on many forms, themajority of which arepetty</p>\n<p>andtrivial. Bald-headed men, for example, are bald forno other reason than their</p>\n<p>fear of criticism. Heads become bald because of thetight fitting bands of hats</p>\n<p>which cut off the circulation from the roots of thehair. Men wear hats, not</p>\n<p>because they actually need them, but mainly because \"everyone is doing it.\" The</p>\n<p>individual falls into line anddoeslikewise, lest some other individual CRITICISE</p>\n<p>him. Women seldom have bald heads, oreven thin hair, because they wear hats</p>\n<p>which fit their heads loosely, theonly purpose ofthe hats being adornment.</p>\n<p>But, it must not be supposed thatwomen arefree from thefear of</p>\n<p>criticism. If any woman claims to be superior to man with reference to this fear,</p>\n<p>ask her to walk down thestreet wearing a hatof thevintageof 1890.</p>\n<p>Theastute manufacturers of clothing have not been slow to capitalize this</p>\n<p>basic fear ofcriticism, with which all mankind has been cursed. Every season the</p>\n<p>styles in many articles of wearing apparel change. Who establishes thestyles?</p>\n<p>Certainly not the purchaser ofclothing, but the manufacturer. Why does he</p>\n<p>changethe styles so often? Theanswer is obvious. Hechanges the styles so he</p>\n<p>can sell more clothes.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 226</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Forthesame reason themanufacturers of automobiles (with a few rare</p>\n<p>andvery sensible exceptions) changestyles of models every season.

Let us</p>\n<p>now examinehuman behavior when this fear affects people in connection with</p>\n<p>the more important events ofhuman relationship. Takeforexample practically</p>\n<p>any person who has reached the age of\"mental maturity\" (from 35 to 40 years of</p>\n<p>age, as a general average), andif youcouldread thesecret thoughts of his mind,</p>\n<p>youwould finda very decided disbelief in most of thefables taught by the</p>\n<p>majority of thedogmatists and theologians a few decades back.</p>\n<p>Not often, however, will youfinda person who has the courage to openly</p>\n<p>state his belief on this subject. Most people will, if pressed farenough, tell a lie</p>\n<p>rather than admit that they do not believe the stories associated with that form of</p>\n<p>religion which held peoplein bondageprior to the ageof scientific discovery and</p>\n<p>education.</p>\n<p>Why doesthe average person, even in this day of enlightenment, shy</p>\n<p>away from denying his belief in the fables which were the basis ofmost of the</p>\n<p>religions a few decades ago? The answer is, \"because of thefear of criticism.\"</p>\n<p>Men andwomen havebeen burned at thestakefordaring to express disbelief in</p>\n<p>ghosts. It is no wonder wehaveinherited a consciousness which makes us fear</p>\n<p>criticism. The timewas, andnot so far in the past, when criticism carried severe</p>\n<p>punishments—it still does in some countries.</p>\n<p>Thefear of criticism robs man of his initiative, destroys his power of</p>\n<p>imagination, limits his individuality, takes away his self-reliance, anddoes him</p>\n<p>damage in a hundred other ways. Parents often do their children irreparable</p>\n<p>injury by criticising them.

Criticism will plant FEAR in thehuman heart, or</p>\n<p>resentment, but it will not build love oraffection.</p>\n<h2>SYMPTOMS    OF THE FEAR  OF CRITICISM</h2>\n<p>This fear is almost as universal as thefear of poverty, andits effects are</p>\n<p>just as fatal to personal achievement, mainly because this fear destroys initiative,</p>\n<p>anddiscourages the useof imagination. Themajorsymptoms of thefear are:</p>\n<p>SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. Generally expressed through</p>\n<p>nervousness, timidity in conversation andin meeting strangers,</p>\n<p>awkward movement of thehands andlimbs, shifting of theeyes.</p>\n<p>LACK OF POISE. Expressed through lack of voice control,</p>\n<p>nervousness in the presence ofothers, poorposture of body, poor</p>\n<p>memory.</p>\n<p>PERSONALITY. Lacking in firmness ofdecision, personal</p>\n<p>charm, andability to express opinions definitely. Thehabitof side-</p>\n<p>stepping issues instead of meeting them squarely. Agreeing with</p>\n<p>others without careful examination of their opinions.</p>\n<p>INFERIORITY COMPLEX. Thehabit ofexpressing self-</p>\n<p>approval by word ofmouth andby actions, as a means ofcovering</p>\n<p>up a feeling of inferiority. Using \"big words\" to impress others,</p>\n<p>(often withoutknowing thereal meaning of thewords). Imitating</p>\n<p>others in dress, speech andmanners. Boasting of imaginary</p>\n<p>achievements. This sometimes givesa surface appearance ofa</p>\n<p>feeling ofsuperiority.</p>\n<p>EXTRAVAGANCE.  The habit of trying to \"keep up with the</p>\n<p>Joneses,\" spending beyond one\'s income.</p>\n<p>LACK OF INITIATIVE. Failure to embrace opportunities for</p>\n<p>self-advancement, fear to express opinions, lack of confidence in</p>\n<p>one\'s own ideas, giving evasiveanswers to questions asked by</p>\n<p>superiors, hesitancy of manner andspeech, deceit in both words</p>\n<p>anddeeds.</p>\n<p>LACK OF AMBITION.

It is closely</p>\n<p>associated, as to its origin, with the causes of fear of OldAge andthefear of</p>\n<p>Death, because it leads oneclosely to the border of \"terrible worlds\" of which</p>\n<p>man knows not, butconcerning which he has been taught some discomforting</p>\n<p>stories. Theopinion is somewhat general, also, that certain unethical people</p>\n<p>engaged in thebusiness of \"selling health\" havehadnota little to do with</p>\n<p>keeping alive thefear of ill health.</p>\n<p>In themain, man fears ill health because of theterrible pictures which</p>\n<p>havebeen planted in his mind ofwhat may happen if death shouldovertake</p>\n<p>him. Healso fearsit because of theeconomic toll which it may claim.</p>\n<p>A reputable physician estimated that75% ofall people who visit</p>\n<p>physicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria (imaginary</p>\n<p>illness). It has been shown most convincingly that thefear of disease, even where</p>\n<p>there is not theslightest cause forfear, often produces the physical symptoms of</p>\n<p>the disease feared.</p>\n<p>Powerful and mighty is thehuman mind! Itbuilds orit destroys.</p>\n<p>Playing upon this commonweakness offear of ill health, dispensers of</p>\n<p>patent medicines havereaped fortunes. This form of imposition upon credulous</p>\n<p>humanity became so prevalent sometwenty years ago that Colliers\' Weekly</p>\n<p>Magazine conducted a bitter campaign against some ofthe worstoffenders in the</p>\n<p>patent medicine business.</p>\n<p>During the \"flu\" epidemic which brokeoutduring theworldwar, the</p>\n<p>mayor ofNew York City took drastic steps to check thedamage which people</p>\n<p>were doing themselves through their inherent fear ofill health.

Unless youcooperate</p>\n<p>with me, wewill havea situation which wecannot control.\" Thenewspapers quit</p>\n<p>publishing stories about the\"flu,\" and within onemonth theepidemic had been</p>\n<p>successfully checked.</p>\n<p>Through a series of experiments conducted some years ago, it was proved</p>\n<p>that people may be made ill by suggestion.

Thespecialist changednurses,</p>\n<p>placing him in chargeof a very charming young woman who began (by pre-</p>\n<p>arrangement with thedoctor)to makelove to him the first day of herarrival on</p>\n<p>the job. Within three weeks thepatient was discharged from thehospital, still</p>\n<p>suffering, but with an entirely different malady. HEWAS IN LOVE AGAIN.

Fear of ill health breaks down Nature\'s</p>\n<p>body resistance, and creates a favorable condition forany form of</p>\n<p>disease onemay contact.</p>\n<p>Thefear of ill health often is related to thefear of Poverty,</p>\n<p>especially in thecase ofthe hypochondriac, who constantly worries</p>\n<p>about thepossibility ofhaving to pay doctor\'s bills, hospital bills,</p>\n<p>etc. This type ofperson spends much time preparing forsickness,</p>\n<p>talking aboutdeath, saving money forcemetery lots, andburial</p>\n<p>expenses, etc.</p>\n<p>SELF-CODDLING.

This fear is themost painful ofall</p>\n<p>the six basic fears. It probably plays more havocwith the body andmind than</p>\n<p>any ofthe other basic fears, as it often leads to permanent insanity.</p>\n<p>Thefear of theloss of loveprobably dates back to thestoneage, when</p>\n<p>men stolewomen by brute force. They continue to steal females, but their</p>\n<p>technique has changed. Instead of force, they now use persuasion, thepromise of</p>\n<p>pretty clothes, motorcars, and other \"bait\" much more effective than physical</p>\n<p>force. Man\'s habits are the same as they were at thedawn of civilization, but he</p>\n<p>expresses them differently.</p>\n<p>Careful analysis has shown that women are more susceptible to this fear</p>\n<p>than men. This fact is easily explained. Women have learned, from experience,</p>\n<p>that men are polygamous by nature, thatthey are not to be trusted in thehands</p>\n<p>of rivals.</p>\n<h2>SYMPTOMS   OF THE  FEAR OF LOSS OF LOVE</h2>\n<p>Thedistinguishing symptoms of this fear are:—</p>\n<p>JEALOUSY.

Thehabitof theman orwoman of forty dressing with the</p>\n<p>aim of trying to appear much younger, andaffecting mannerisms</p>\n<p>of youth; thereby inspiring ridicule by both friends andstrangers.</p>\n<h2>THE  FEAR OF DEATH</h2>\n<p>Tosomethis is thecruelest ofall the basic fears. The reason is obvious.</p>\n<p>Theterrible pangs of fear associated with thethought ofdeath, in themajority of</p>\n<p>cases, may be charged directly to religious fanaticism. So-called \"heathen\" are</p>\n<p>less afraid of death than the more \"civilized.\" Forhundreds ofmillions ofyears</p>\n<p>man has been asking the still unanswered questions, \"whence\" and\"whither.\"</p>\n<p>Where didI come from, and where am Igoing?</p>\n<p>During the darker ages of thepast, themorecunning andcrafty were not</p>\n<p>slow to offer theanswer to thesequestions, FOR APRICE. Witness, now, the</p>\n<p>majorsource of origin ofthe FEAR OF DEATH.</p>\n<p>\"Come into my tent, embrace my faith, accept my dogmas, and Iwill give</p>\n<p>youa ticket thatwill admit you straightaway into heaven when youdie,\" cries a</p>\n<p>leader of sectarianism. \"Remain outofmy tent,\" says thesameleader, \"and may</p>\n<p>the devil take youandburn youthroughout eternity.\"</p>\n<p>ETERNITY is a long time. FIRE is a terrible thing. The thought of eternal</p>\n<p>punishment, with fire,not only causes man to fear death, it often causes him to</p>\n<p>losehis reason. Itdestroys interest in lifeandmakes happiness impossible.</p>\n<p>During my research, Ireviewed a book entitled \"A Catalogue ofthe</p>\n<p>Gods,\" in which were listed the 30,000 gods which man has worshiped. Think of</p>\n<p>it! Thirty thousandof them, represented by everything from a crawfish to a man.</p>\n<p>It is little wonder thatmen have become frightened at theapproach ofdeath.</p>\n<p>Whilethe religious leader may not be able to provide safeconduct into</p>\n<p>heaven, nor, by lack ofsuch provision, allow theunfortunate to descend into</p>\n<p>hell, the possibility of thelatter seems so terrible that thevery thought of it lays</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 234</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>holdofthe imagination in such a realistic way that it paralyzes reason, andsets</p>\n<p>up thefear of death.</p>\n<p>In truth, NO MAN KNOWS, and no man has ever known, what heaven or</p>\n<p>hell is like,nordoes any man know if either place actually exists. This very lack</p>\n<p>of positive knowledge opens thedoor ofthe human mind to the charlatan so he</p>\n<p>may enter and control thatmind with his stock of legerdemain and various</p>\n<p>brands of pious fraud and trickery.</p>\n<p>Thefear of DEATH is not as commonnow as it was during the age when</p>\n<p>there were no greatcolleges and universities. Men ofscience haveturned the</p>\n<p>spotlight oftruth upon theworld, and this truth is rapidly freeing men and</p>\n<p>women from this terrible fear of DEATH. Theyoung men and young women</p>\n<p>who attend thecolleges and universities arenot easily impressed by \"fire\" and</p>\n<p>\"brimstone.\" Through theaid ofbiology, astronomy, geology, and other related</p>\n<p>sciences, the fears of thedark ages which gripped the minds of men and</p>\n<p>destroyed theirreason have been dispelled.</p>\n<p>Insane asylums are filled with men andwomen who have gonemad,</p>\n<p>because of theFEAR OF DEATH.</p>\n<p>This fear is useless. Death will come, nomatter what anyonemay think</p>\n<p>about it. Accept it as a necessity, andpass thethought outof your mind. Itmust</p>\n<p>be a, necessity, orit would not come to all. Perhaps it is not as badas it has been</p>\n<p>pictured.</p>\n<p>Theentire world is made up of only two things, ENERGY and MATTER.</p>\n<p>In elementary physics welearn that neither matter norenergy (theonly two</p>\n<p>realities known to man) can be created nordestroyed. Both matter andenergy</p>\n<p>can be transformed, but neither can be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Life is energy, if it is anything. If neither energy normatter can be</p>\n<p>destroyed, of course life cannot be destroyed. Life, like other forms of energy,</p>\n<p>may be passed through various processes of transition, orchange, but it cannot</p>\n<p>be destroyed. Death is mere transition.</p>\n<p>If death is not mere change,ortransition, then nothing comes after death</p>\n<p>except a long, eternal, peaceful sleep, andsleep is nothing to be feared. Thus you</p>\n<p>may wipe out, forever, thefear of Death.</p>\n<h2>SYMPTOMS    OF THE FEAR OF DEATH</h2>\n<p>Thegeneral symptoms of this fear are:—</p>\n<p>Thehabitof THINKING about dying instead of making the</p>\n<p>most ofLIFE, due, generally, to lack of purpose, orlack ofa suitable</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 235</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>occupation. This fear is more prevalent among theaged, but</p>\n<p>sometimes the more youthful are victims ofit. Thegreatest ofall</p>\n<p>remedies forthe fear ofdeath is a BURNING DESIRE FOR</p>\n<p>ACHIEVEMENT,  backed by useful service to others. Abusy person</p>\n<p>seldom has timeto think aboutdying. Hefinds lifetoo thrilling to</p>\n<p>worry about death. Sometimes thefear of death is closely</p>\n<p>associated with theFear ofPoverty, where one\'s death would leave</p>\n<p>lovedones poverty-stricken. In other cases, the fear ofdeath is</p>\n<p>caused by illness and theconsequent breaking down of physical</p>\n<p>body resistance. Thecommonest causes ofthe fearof death are: ill-</p>\n<p>health, poverty, lack of appropriate occupation, disappointment</p>\n<p>over love, insanity, religious fanaticism.</p>\n<h2>OLD MAN  WORRY</h2>\n<p>Worry is a state ofmind based upon fear. It works slowly, but</p>\n<p>persistently. It is insiduous and subtle. Step by stepit \"digs itself in\" until it</p>\n<p>paralyzes one\'s reasoning faculty, destroys self-confidence andinitiative.Worry</p>\n<p>is a form ofsustained fear caused by indecision therefore it is a state ofmind</p>\n<p>which can be controlled.</p>\n<p>An unsettled mind is helpless. Indecision makes an unsettled mind. Most</p>\n<p>individuals lack the willpower to reach decisions promptly, andto stand by them</p>\n<p>after they have been made, even during normal business conditions. During</p>\n<p>periods of economicunrest (such as the world recently experienced), the</p>\n<p>individual is handicapped, not alone by his inherent nature to be slow at</p>\n<p>reaching decisions, but heis influenced by the indecision ofothersaround him</p>\n<p>who have created a state of\"mass indecision.\"</p>\n<p>During the depression thewholeatmosphere, all over theworld, was</p>\n<p>filled with \"Fearenza\" and\"Worryitis,\" thetwo mental diseasegerms which</p>\n<p>began to spread themselves after theWall Street frenzy in 1929. There is only one</p>\n<p>known antidote for thesegerms; it is thehabit of promptand firm DECISION.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is an antidote which every individual must apply forhimself.</p>\n<p>We do notworry over conditions, once wehavereached a decision to</p>\n<p>follow a definite line ofaction.</p>\n<p>I once interviewed a man who was to beelectrocuted two hours later.

His calmness prompted meto ask him how it feltto know that he was</p>\n<p>going into eternity in a shortwhile. With a smileof confidence onhis face, he</p>\n<p>said, \"Itfeels fine.Just think, brother, my troubles will soon be over. Ihave had</p>\n<p>nothing but trouble all my life.It has been a hardship to get foodand clothing.</p>\n<p>Soon I will notneed these things. I have feltfine ever since I learned FOR</p>\n<p>CERTAIN thatImust die.I made up my mind then, to accept my fatein good</p>\n<p>spirit.\"</p>\n<p>As he spoke hedevoured a dinnerof proportions sufficient forthree men,</p>\n<p>eating every mouthful of thefood brought to him, and apparently enjoying it as</p>\n<p>much as if no disaster awaited him. DECISION gave this man resignation to his</p>\n<p>fate! Decision can also prevent one\'s acceptance of undesired circumstances.</p>\n<p>Thesix basic fears become translated into a stateof worry, through</p>\n<p>indecision. Relieve yourself, forever ofthe fear ofdeath, by reaching a decision to</p>\n<p>accept death as an inescapable event. Whip the fear ofpoverty by reaching a</p>\n<p>decision to get along with whatever wealth youcan accumulate WITHOUT</p>\n<p>WORRY.  Put your footupon theneck of the fear ofcriticism by reaching a</p>\n<p>decision NOT TOWORRY about what other people think, do, orsay. Eliminate</p>\n<p>the fear ofold ageby reaching a decision to accept it, not as a handicap, but as a</p>\n<p>great blessing which carries with it wisdom, self-control, andunderstanding not</p>\n<p>known to youth.</p>\n<p>Acquit yourself ofthe fear ofill health by the decision to forget symptoms.</p>\n<p>Master thefear of loss oflove by reaching a decision to get along without love, if</p>\n<p>that is necessary.</p>\n<p>Kill the habitof worry, in all its forms, by reaching a general, blanket</p>\n<p>decision that nothing which life has to offer is worththe price ofworry. With this</p>\n<p>decision will comepoise, peace ofmind, andcalmness of thought which will</p>\n<p>bring happiness.</p>\n<p>A man whosemind is filledwith fear not only destroys his own chances of</p>\n<p>intelligent action, but, he transmits these destructive vibrations to the minds of</p>\n<p>all who come into contact with him, anddestroys, also their chances.</p>\n<p>Even a dog ora horseknows when its master lacks courage; moreover, a</p>\n<p>dog ora horse will pick upthe vibrations offear thrown off by its master, and</p>\n<p>behave accordingly. Lower down theline ofintelligence in theanimal kingdom,</p>\n<p>onefinds this samecapacity to pick up thevibrations of fear. Ahoney-bee</p>\n<p>immediately senses fear in the mind of a person—forreasons unknown, a bee</p>\n<p>will sting theperson whosemind is releasing vibrations of fear, much more</p>\n<p>readily than it will molest theperson whosemindregisters no fear.</p>\n<p>DoYouFeelFrustrated,StuckOrOverwhelmedbytheConceptsinthiseBook? 237</p>\n<p>Discover HowToBeginMovingForwardwithFREEAudio&amp;VideoTrainingat:</p>\n<h2>                            </h2>\n<p>www.think-and-grow-rich-ebook.com</p>\n<h2>                     </h2>\n<p>THINK &amp; GROW  RICH</p>\n<p>Thevibrations offear pass from onemind to another justas quickly andas</p>\n<p>surely as thesound of thehuman voice passes from the broadcasting station to</p>\n<p>the receiving setof a radio—andBY THESELF-SAME MEDIUM.</p>\n<p>Mental telepathy is a reality.

First ofall, andperhaps most important to be remembered, the</p>\n<p>person who releases thoughts ofa destructive nature, must suffer damage</p>\n<p>through the breaking down ofthe faculty of creative imagination. Secondly, the</p>\n<p>presence in the mind ofany destructive emotion develops a negativepersonality</p>\n<p>which repels people, andoften converts them into antagonists. Thethird source</p>\n<p>of damage to theperson who entertains orreleases negativethoughts, lies in this</p>\n<p>significant fact— these thought-impulses are not only damaging to others, but</p>\n<p>they IMBED THEMSELVES IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE PERSON</p>\n<p>RELEASING THEM, andthere become a part of his character.</p>\n<p>One is never through with a thought, merely by releasing it.

It constitutes a rich soil in which theseeds of failure grow abundantly. It is</p>\n<p>so subtle that its presence often is notdetected. This affliction cannot properly be</p>\n<p>classed as a fear. IT IS MORE DEEPLY SEATED AND MORE OFTEN FATAL</p>\n<p>THAN  ALL OF THESIX FEARS.

This evil is also</p>\n<p>dangerous because it strikesin as many different forms as there are human</p>\n<p>experiences. Sometimes it enters the mind through thewell-meant words of one\'s</p>\n<p>own relatives. At other times, it bores from within, through one\'s own mental</p>\n<p>attitude.

Why do people cling</p>\n<p>to their pet alibis? The answer is obvious. They defend theiralibis because THEY</p>\n<p>CREATE them! Aman\'s alibiis thechildof his own imagination. It is human</p>\n<p>nature to defend one\'s own brain-child.</p>\n<p>Building alibis is a deeply rooted habit. Habits are difficult to break,</p>\n<p>especially when they provide justification forsomething we do. Plato hadthis</p>\n<p>truth in mind when he said, \"Thefirst andbest victory is to conquer self. To be</p>\n<p>conquered by self is, of all things, themost shameful andvile.\"</p>\n<p>Another philosopherhad thesamethought in mind whenhesaid, \"It was</p>\n<p>a great surprise to me whenIdiscovered that most of theugliness I saw in</p>\n<p>others, was but a reflection of my own nature.\"</p>\n<p>\"It has always been a mystery to me,\" said Elbert Hubbard, \"why people</p>\n<p>spend so much timedeliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to cover</p>\n<p>their weaknesses. If used differently, this same timewouldbe sufficient to cure</p>\n<p>the weakness, then no alibis would be needed.\"</p>\n<p>In parting, Iwouldremind youthat \"Lifeis a checkerboard, andthe player</p>\n<p>opposite youis TIME. If youhesitate before moving, orneglect to move</p>\n<p>promptly, yourmen will be wiped off theboard by TIME. You are playing</p>\n<p>against a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!\"</p>\n<p>Previously youmay havehada logical excuse for not having forced Life</p>\n<p>to comethrough with whatever youasked, but that alibi is now obsolete, because</p>\n<p>youare in possession of theMaster Key that unlocks thedoorto Life\'s bountiful</p>\n<p>riches.</p>\n<p>TheMaster Key is intangible, but it is powerful! It is the privilege of</p>\n<p>creating, in your own mind, a BURNING DESIRE for a definite form ofriches.</p>\n<p>There is no penalty forthe use of the Key, but there is a price youmust pay if you</p>\n<p>do not useit. Theprice is FAILURE. There is a reward of stupendous proportions</p>\n<p>if youputthe Key to use.
